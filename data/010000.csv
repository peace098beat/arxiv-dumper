Germany included the cancellation of mass events (from March 8), closures of
schools and child day care facilities (from March 16) as well as a ""lockdown""
(from March 23). This study attempts to assess the effectiveness of these
interventions in terms of revealing their impact on infections over time.
Methods: Dates of infections were estimated from official German case data by
incorporating the incubation period and an empirical reporting delay.
Exponential growth models for infections and reproduction numbers were
estimated and investigated with respect to change points in the time series.
Results: A significant decline of daily and cumulative infections as well as
reproduction numbers is found at March 8 (CI [7, 9]), March 10 (CI [9, 11] and
March 3 (CI [2, 4]), respectively. Further declines and stabilizations are
found in the end of March. There is also a change point in new infections at
April 19 (CI [18, 20]), but daily infections still show a negative growth. From
March 19 (CI [18, 20]), the reproduction numbers fluctuate on a level below
one. Conclusions: The decline of infections in early March 2020 can be
attributed to relatively small interventions and voluntary behavioural changes.
Additional effects of later interventions cannot be detected clearly.
Liberalizations of measures did not induce a re-increase of infections. Thus,
the effectiveness of most German interventions remains questionable. Moreover,
assessing of interventions is impeded by the estimation of true infection dates

curves and the median of the degree of polarization (PD), are essential for
distinguishing between FSRQs and BL Lac objects. FSRQs are characterized by
rare and large flares, while the variability of BL Lac objects can be
reproduced with a stationary OU process with relatively small amplitudes. The
characteristics of the variability are governed not by the differences in the
jet structure between the subtypes, but by the peak frequency of the
synchrotron emission. This implies that the nature of the variation in the jets
is common in FSRQs and BL Lac objects. We found that BL Lac objects tend to
have high PD medians, which suggests that they have a stable polarization
component. FSRQs have no such component, possibly because of a strong Compton
cooling effect in sub-pc scale jets.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=10000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Blazars can be divided into two subtypes, flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs)\nand BL Lac objects, which have been distinguished phenomenologically by the\nstrength of their optical emission lines, while their physical nature and\nrelationship are still not fully understood.

FSRQs are characterized by\nrare and large flares, while the variability of BL Lac objects can be\nreproduced with a stationary OU process with relatively small amplitudes. The\ncharacteristics of the variability are governed not by the differences in the\njet structure between the subtypes, but by the peak frequency of the\nsynchrotron emission. This implies that the nature of the variation in the jets\nis common in FSRQs and BL Lac objects. We found that BL Lac objects tend to\nhave high PD medians, which suggests that they have a stable polarization\ncomponent. FSRQs have no such component, possibly because of a strong Compton\ncooling effect in sub-pc scale jets.'}","[{'name': 'Makoto Uemura'}, {'name': 'Taisei Abe'}, {'name': 'Yurika Yamada'}, {'name': 'Shiro Ikeda'}]",{'name': 'Shiro Ikeda'},Shiro Ikeda,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pasj/psaa063', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.07792v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.07792v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'astro-ph.HE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'astro-ph.HE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]","13 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in PASJ",10.1093/pasj/psaa063,,

Experiments on two real-world datasets show that our\nmodel achieves superior clustering performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks\nand identifies meaningful clusters that can be translated into actionable\ninformation for clinical decision-making.'}","[{'name': 'Changhee Lee'}, {'name': 'Mihaela van der Schaar'}]",{'name': 'Mihaela van der Schaar'},Mihaela van der Schaar,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08600v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08600v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'physics.med-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'physics.med-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,,

observations of the Narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 359. We aim to provide the
first broadband spectral modeling of Mrk 359 describing its emission spectrum

The spectral broadband modelling assumes the standard hot Comptonising corona
and reflection component, while for the soft excess we tested two different
models: a warm, optically thick Comptonising corona (the two-corona model) and
a reflection model in which the soft-excess is the result of a blurred
reflected continuum and line emission (the reflection model). High and low flux
states were observed during the campaign. The former state has a softer
spectral shape, while the latter shows a harder one. The photon index is in the

matter, is observed. Regarding the soft excess, we found that among the

typically weak. The fraction of stars with detectable He I IR variation remains
lower than 10% for stars earlier than M3.0 V, while it exceeds 30% for the

additional temporal dimension, which allows us to model the inherent rhythms

we can transform the time series prediction and missing data imputation
problems into a universal low-rank tensor completion problem. Besides
minimizing tensor rank, we also integrate a novel autoregressive norm on the
original matrix representation into the objective function. The two components
serve different roles. The low-rank structure allows us to effectively capture
the global consistency and trends across all the three dimensions (i.e.,
similarity among sensors, similarity of different days, and current time v.s.

series modeling. Echo State Networks (ESNs), as a prime example of Reservoir
Computing (RC) models, are known for their fast and precise one-shot learning,
that often benefit from good hyper-parameter tuning. This makes them ideal to
change the status quo.
  Methods: We discuss CV of time series for predicting a concrete time interval
of interest, suggest several schemes for cross-validating ESNs and introduce an
efficient algorithm for implementing them. This algorithm is presented as two
levels of optimizations of doing $k$-fold CV. Training an RC model typically
consists of two stages: (i) running the reservoir with the data and (ii)
computing the optimal readouts. The first level of our optimization addresses
the most computationally expensive part (i) and makes it remain constant
irrespective of $k$. It dramatically reduces reservoir computations in any type
of RC system and is enough if $k$ is small. The second level of optimization
also makes the (ii) part remain constant irrespective of large $k$, as long as
the dimension of the output is low. We discuss when the proposed validation
schemes for ESNs could be beneficial, three options for producing the final
model and empirically investigate them on six different real-world datasets, as
well as do empirical computation time experiments. We provide the code in an

  Results: Proposed CV schemes give better and more stable test performance in
all the six different real-world datasets, three task types. Empirical run
times confirm our complexity analysis.

exhibit heavy fluctuations from one time step to the next (typically on the
order of 0.1-1 second). Short-term forecasts (10-30 seconds into the future) of
traffic conditions are critical for traffic operations applications (e.g.,
adaptive signal control). But traffic forecasting tools in the literature deal
predominantly with 3-5 minute aggregated data, where the typical signal cycle
is on the order of 2 minutes. This renders such forecasts useless at the
operations level. To this end, we model the traffic forecasting problem as a
matrix completion problem, where the forecasting inputs are mapped to a higher
dimensional space using kernels. The formulation allows us to capture both
nonlinear dependencies between forecasting inputs and outputs but also allows
us to capture dependencies among the inputs. These dependencies correspond to
correlations between different locations in the network. We further employ
adaptive boosting to enhance the training accuracy and capture historical

COVID-19, countries relied on a number of nonpharmaceutical interventions to
fight the first wave of the pandemic. The most prevalent one has been
stay-at-home orders, whose the goal is to limit the physical contact between
people, which consequently will reduce the number of secondary infections
generated. In this work, we use a detailed set of mobility data to evaluate the
impact that these interventions had on alleviating the spread of the virus in
the US as measured through the COVID-19-related deaths. To establish this
impact, we use the notion of Granger causality between two time-series. We show
that there is a unidirectional Granger causality, from the median percentage of
time spent daily at home to the daily number of COVID-19-related deaths with a
lag of 2 weeks. We further analyze the mobility patterns at the census block

results show that under-reporting rates vary significantly between states and

normalisation of spectra. Methods: We developed RASSINE, a Python code for
normalising merged 1D spectra through the concepts of convex hulls. The code
uses six parameters that can be easily fine-tuned. The code also provides a
complete user-friendly interactive interface, including graphical feedback,
that helps the user to choose the parameters as easily as possible. To
facilitate the normalisation even further, RASSINE can provide a first guess
for the parameters that are derived directly from the merged 1D spectrum based
on previously performed calibrations. Results: For HARPS spectra of the Sun
that were obtained with the HELIOS solar telescope, a continuum accuracy of
0.20% on line depth can be reached after normalisation with RASSINE. This is
three times better than with the commonly used method of polynomial fitting.
For HARPS spectra of $\alpha$ Cen B, a continuum accuracy of 2.0% is reached.
This rather poor accuracy is mainly due to molecular band absorption and the
high density of spectral lines in the bluest part of the merged 1D spectrum.
When wavelengths shorter than 4500 \AA are excluded, the continuum accuracy
improves by up to 1.2%. The line-depth precision on individual spectrum
normalisation is estimated to be 0.15%, which can be reduced to the
photon-noise limit (0.10%) when a time series of spectra is given as input for
RASSINE. Conclusions: With a continuum accuracy higher than the polynomial
fitting method and a line-depth precision compatible with photon noise, RASSINE
is a tool that can find applications in numerous cases, for example stellar
parameter determination, transmission spectroscopy of exoplanet atmospheres, or
activity-sensitive line detection.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=10000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Aims: We provide an open-source code allowing an easy, intuitive, and robust\nnormalisation of spectra.

which exhibits a short and long-term chromospheric cycles of near 3 and 13-yr

and support vector machine (SVM), to predict monthly groundwater level (GWL),
evaluate uncertainty analysis of predictions and spatial variation analysis.
The six schemes, including grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA), cat swarm
optimization (CSO), weed algorithm (WA), genetic algorithm (GA), krill
algorithm (KA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO), were used to hybridize
for improving the performance of ANN, SVM, and ANFIS models. Groundwater level
(GWL) data of Ardebil plain (Iran) for a period of 144 months were selected to
evaluate the hybrid models. The pre-processing technique of principal component
analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce input combinations from monthly time
series up to 12-month prediction intervals. The results showed that the
ANFIS-GOA was superior to the other hybrid models for predicting GWL in the
first piezometer and third piezometer in the testing stage. The performance of
hybrid models with optimization algorithms was far better than that of
classical ANN, ANFIS, and SVM models without hybridization. The percent of
improvements in the ANFIS-GOA versus standalone ANFIS in piezometer 10 were

of fine-grained data is not yet established. Here, we employ rigorous
statistical methods to deduce guarantees for the optimal coarse models obtained
via approximations of the multi-body potential of mean force, with the relative
entropy, the relative entropy rate minimization, and the force matching
methods. Specifically, we present and apply statistical approaches, such as
bootstrap and jackknife, to infer confidence sets for a limited number of
samples, i.e., molecular configurations. Moreover, we estimate asymptotic
confidence intervals assuming adequate sampling of the phase space. We
demonstrate the need for non-asymptotic methods and quantify confidence sets
through two applications. The first is a two-scale fast/slow diffusion process
projected on the slow process. With this benchmark example, we establish the
methodology for both independent and time-series data. Second, we apply these
uncertainty quantification approaches on a polymeric bulk system. We consider
an atomistic polyethylene melt as the prototype system for developing

spots and bright faculae) significantly influence the determination of the
parameters of an exoplanet. The chromatic effect they have on transmission

as JWST and Ariel.
  To quantify and mitigate the effects of those surface phenomena, we developed
a modelling approach to derive the surface distribution and properties of
active regions by modelling simultaneous multi-wavelength time-series
observables. By using the StarSim code, now featuring the capability to solve
the inverse problem, we analysed $\sim$ 600 days of BVRI multiband photometry

we simulated the chromatic contribution of surface phenomena on the observables

  We are able to determine the relevant activity parameters of WASP-52 and
reconstruct the time-evolving longitudinal map of active regions. The star
shows a heterogeneous surface composed of dark spots with a mean temperature
contrast of $575\pm150$ K with filling factors ranging from 3 to 14 %. We
studied the chromatic effects on the depths of transits obtained at different
epochs with different stellar spot distributions. For WASP-52, with
peak-to-peak photometric variations of $\sim$7 % in the visible, the residual
effects of dark spots on the measured transit depth, after applying the
calculated corrections, are about $10^{-4}$ at 550 nm and $3\times10^{-5}$ at
6$\mu$m.
  We demonstrate that by using contemporaneous ground-based multiband

and aggravates operation and maintenance. To sustain control over large sets of
hosts and the connecting networks, monitoring solutions are employed and
constantly enhanced. They collect diverse key performance indicators (KPIs)
(e.g. CPU utilization, allocated memory, etc.) and provide detailed information
about the system state. Storing such metrics over a period of time naturally
raises the motivation of predicting future KPI progress based on past
observations. Although, a variety of time series forecasting methods exist,
forecasting the progress of IT system KPIs is very hard. First, KPI types like
CPU utilization or allocated memory are very different and hard to be expressed
by the same model. Second, system components are interconnected and constantly
changing due to soft- or firmware updates and hardware modernization. Thus a
frequent model retraining or fine-tuning must be expected. Therefore, we
propose a lightweight solution for KPI series prediction based on historic
observations. It consists of a weighted heterogeneous ensemble method composed
of two models - a neural network and a mean predictor. As ensemble method a
weighted summation is used, whereby a heuristic is employed to set the weights.
The modelling approach is evaluated on the available FedCSIS 2020 challenge

Storing such metrics over a period of time naturally\nraises the motivation of predicting future KPI progress based on past\nobservations. Although, a variety of time series forecasting methods exist,\nforecasting the progress of IT system KPIs is very hard. First, KPI types like\nCPU utilization or allocated memory are very different and hard to be expressed\nby the same model. Second, system components are interconnected and constantly\nchanging due to soft- or firmware updates and hardware modernization. Thus a\nfrequent model retraining or fine-tuning must be expected. Therefore, we\npropose a lightweight solution for KPI series prediction based on historic\nobservations. It consists of a weighted heterogeneous ensemble method composed\nof two models - a neural network and a mean predictor.

insight for traffic planning purposes. An important requirement for this
monitoring is the availability of methods to automatically detect major traffic
events and to annotate the abundance of travel data. This paper introduces a
machine learning based approach for reliable detection and characterization of
highway traffic congestion events from hundreds of hours of traffic speed data.
Indeed, the proposed approach is a generic approach for detection of changes in
any given time series, which is the wireless traffic sensor data in the present
study. The speed data is initially time-windowed by a ten-hour long sliding
window and fed into three Neural Networks that are used to detect the existence
and duration of congestion events (slowdowns) in each window. The sliding
window captures each slowdown event multiple times and results in increased
confidence in congestion detection. The training and parameter tuning are
performed on 17,483 hours of data that includes 168 slowdown events. This data
is collected and labeled as part of the ongoing probe data validation studies
at the Center for Advanced Transportation Technologies (CATT) at the University
of Maryland. The Neural networks are carefully trained to reduce the chances of
over-fitting to the training data. The experimental results show that this
approach is able to successfully detect most of the congestion events, while
significantly outperforming a heuristic rule-based approach. Moreover, the
proposed approach is shown to be more accurate in estimation of the start-time

This paper introduces a\nmachine learning based approach for reliable detection and characterization of\nhighway traffic congestion events from hundreds of hours of traffic speed data.\nIndeed, the proposed approach is a generic approach for detection of changes in\nany given time series, which is the wireless traffic sensor data in the present\nstudy. The speed data is initially time-windowed by a ten-hour long sliding\nwindow and fed into three Neural Networks that are used to detect the existence\nand duration of congestion events (slowdowns) in each window. The sliding\nwindow captures each slowdown event multiple times and results in increased\nconfidence in congestion detection. The training and parameter tuning are\nperformed on 17,483 hours of data that includes 168 slowdown events. This data\nis collected and labeled as part of the ongoing probe data validation studies\nat the Center for Advanced Transportation Technologies (CATT) at the University\nof Maryland. The Neural networks are carefully trained to reduce the chances of\nover-fitting to the training data. The experimental results show that this\napproach is able to successfully detect most of the congestion events, while\nsignificantly outperforming a heuristic rule-based approach. Moreover, the\nproposed approach is shown to be more accurate in estimation of the start-time\nand end-time of the congestion events.'}","[{'name': 'Sanaz Aliari'}, {'name': 'Kaveh F.

Managing hospital demand effectively requires an adequate knowledge of the

rotation (SDR), the correlation between chromospheric activity indicators and
the spatial connection between chromospheric and photospheric activities on the
active star Kepler-411, using time series photometry over 4 years from Kepler,
and spectroscopic data from Keck I 10-m telescope and Lijiang 2.4-m telescope.
We constructed the light curve by re-performing photometry and reduction from
the Target Pixel Files and Cotrending Basis Vectors with a manually redefined
aperture using the software PyKE3. An efficient program, GEMC_LCM, was
developed to apply a two-spots model to chosen light curve segments with three
spot groups at fixed latitudes (30, 45), (30, 60) and (45, 60). We found a
periodic variation of the starspots at period of about 660 days which independs
on spot latitudes, and estimated the lower limit of SDR as $P_{\text{eq}} =
9.7810(0.0169)$ days and $\alpha = 0.1016(0.0023)$. Simultaneously, the
relative variations of chromospheric activity indicators were derived by
subtracting the overall mean spectrum from individual spectrum. It is found
that Ca II H and K emissions are strongly correlated with each other, and there
also exists a correlation between H$\alpha$ and Ca II H & K emissions, with
large dispersion, in accordance with previous results. Furthermore we find the
correlation between Ca II H and K emissions is different in 2011 and 2012. The

prominent crisis. As of May 19, 2020, the virus had spread to 215 countries
with more than 4,622,001 confirmed cases and 311,916 reported deaths worldwide,
including Algeria with 7201 cases and 555 deaths. Analyze and forecast COVID-19
cases and deaths growth could be useful in many ways, governments could
estimate medical equipment and take appropriate policy responses, and experts
could approximate the peak and the end of the disease. In this work, we first
train a time series Prophet model to analyze and forecast the number of
COVID-19 cases and deaths in Algeria based on the previously reported numbers.
Then, to better understand the spread and the properties of the COVID-19, we
include external factors that may contribute to accelerate/slow the spread of
the virus, construct a dataset from reliable sources, and conduct a large-scale
data analysis considering 82 countries worldwide. The evaluation results show
that the time series Prophet model accurately predicts the number of cases and
deaths in Algeria with low RMSE scores of 218.87 and 4.79 respectively, while
the forecast suggests that the total number of cases and deaths are expected to
increase in the coming weeks. Moreover, the worldwide data-driven analysis
reveals several correlations between the increase/decrease in the number of

matrices is closely related to the degrees of nonstationarity of autoregressive
models for time series and longitudinal data. Heuristically, one expects for a
nearly stationary covariance matrix the entries in each subdiagonal of the
Cholesky factor of its inverse to be nearly the same in the sense that sum of
absolute values of successive terms is small. Statistically such smoothness is
achieved by regularizing each subdiagonal using fused-type lasso penalties. We
rely on the standard Cholesky factor as the new parameters within a regularized
normal likelihood setup which guarantees: (1) joint convexity of the likelihood
function, (2) strict convexity of the likelihood function restricted to each
subdiagonal even when $n<p$, and (3) positive-definiteness of the estimated
covariance matrix. A block coordinate descent algorithm, where each block is a
subdiagonal, is proposed and its convergence is established under mild
conditions. Lack of decoupling of the penalized likelihood function into a sum
of functions involving individual subdiagonals gives rise to some computational
challenges and advantages relative to two recent algorithms for sparse

many advances in machine learning and time-series classification. In this work,
we develop a convolutional network module that exploits Electroencephalogram
(EEG) scalograms to distinguish between the pre-seizure and normal brain
activities. Since these scalograms have rectangular image shapes with many more
temporal bins than spectral bins, the presented module uses ""semi-dilated
convolutions"" to create a proportional non-square receptive field. The proposed
semi-dilated convolutions support exponential expansion of the receptive field
over the long dimension (image width, i.e. time) while maintaining high
resolution over the short dimension (image height, i.e., frequency). The
proposed architecture comprises a set of co-operative semi-dilated
convolutional blocks, each block has a stack of parallel semi-dilated
convolutional modules with different dilation rates. Results show that our

By
introducing certain quantum features, such as superposition and collapse of
wavefunction, we experimentally demonstrate a quantum version of Go by using
correlated photon pairs entangled in polarization degree of freedom. The total
dimension of Hilbert space of the generated states grows exponentially as two
players take turns to place the stones in time series. As nondeterministic and
imperfect information games are more difficult to solve using nowadays
technology, we excitedly find that the inherent randomness in quantum physics
can bring the game nondeterministic trait, which does not exist in the
classical counterpart. Some quantum resources, like coherence or entanglement,
can also be encoded to represent the state of quantum stones. Adjusting the
quantum resource may vary the average imperfect information (as comparison
classical Go is a perfect information game) of a single game. We further verify

In this study, we determine the morphology and mass-loss rate of jets
emanating from the companion in post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binary
stars with a circumbinary disk. In doing so, we also determine the mass
accretion rates on to the companion and investigate the source feeding the
circum-companion accretion disk. Methods. We perform a spatio-kinematic
modelling of the jet of two well-sampled post-AGB binaries, BD+46442 and
IRAS19135+3937, by fitting the orbital phased time series of H-alpha spectra.
Once the jet geometry, velocity and scaled density structure are computed, we
carry out radiative transfer modelling of the jet for the first four Balmer
lines to determine the jet densities, thus allowing us to compute the jet
mass-loss rates and mass accretion rates. Results. The spatio-kinematic model
of the jet reproduces the observed absorption feature in the H-alpha lines. In
both objects, the jets have an inner region with extremely low density. Using
our radiative transfer model, we find the full three-dimensional density
structure of both jets. From these results, we can compute mass-loss rates of
the jets, which are of the order of 10^-7 - 10^-5 M_sol/yr. We estimate mass
accretion rates onto the companion of 10^-6 - 10^-4 M_sol/yr. Conclusions.
Based on the mass accretion rates found for these two objects, we conclude that
the circumbinary disk is most likely the source feeding the circum-companion
accretion disk. This is in agreement with the observed depletion patterns in
post-AGB binaries. The high accretion rates from the circumbinary disk imply
that the lifetime of the disk will be short. Mass-transfer from the post-AGB
star cannot be excluded in these systems, but it is unlikely to provide a
sufficient mass-transfer rate to sustain the observed jet mass-loss rates.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=10000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Aims.

In doing so, we also determine the mass\naccretion rates on to the companion and investigate the source feeding the\ncircum-companion accretion disk. Methods. We perform a spatio-kinematic\nmodelling of the jet of two well-sampled post-AGB binaries, BD+46442 and\nIRAS19135+3937, by fitting the orbital phased time series of H-alpha spectra.\nOnce the jet geometry, velocity and scaled density structure are computed, we\ncarry out radiative transfer modelling of the jet for the first four Balmer\nlines to determine the jet densities, thus allowing us to compute the jet\nmass-loss rates and mass accretion rates. Results. The spatio-kinematic model\nof the jet reproduces the observed absorption feature in the H-alpha lines. In\nboth objects, the jets have an inner region with extremely low density. Using\nour radiative transfer model, we find the full three-dimensional density\nstructure of both jets. From these results, we can compute mass-loss rates of\nthe jets, which are of the order of 10^-7 - 10^-5 M_sol/yr. We estimate mass\naccretion rates onto the companion of 10^-6 - 10^-4 M_sol/yr. Conclusions.\nBased on the mass accretion rates found for these two objects, we conclude that\nthe circumbinary disk is most likely the source feeding the circum-companion\naccretion disk. This is in agreement with the observed depletion patterns in\npost-AGB binaries. The high accretion rates from the circumbinary disk imply\nthat the lifetime of the disk will be short. Mass-transfer from the post-AGB\nstar cannot be excluded in these systems, but it is unlikely to provide a\nsufficient mass-transfer rate to sustain the observed jet mass-loss rates.'}","[{'name': 'Dylan Bollen'}, {'name': 'Devika Kamath'}, {'name': 'Orsola De Marco'}, {'name': 'Hans Van Winckel'}, {'name': 'Mark Wardle'}]",{'name': 'Mark Wardle'},Mark Wardle,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/202038414', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14293v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.14293v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]","16 pages, 13 figures, accepted for publication in A&A",10.1051/0004-6361/202038414,,"A&A 641, A175 (2020)"

data stream. For example, when given time series of COVID-19 cases in a region,
we may raise early warning signals of outbreaks by detecting signs of changes
in the cases. We propose a novel methodology to address this issue. The key
idea is to employ a new information-theoretic notion, which we call the
differential minimum description length change statistics (D-MDL), for
measuring the scores of change sign. We first give a fundamental theory for
D-MDL. We then demonstrate its effectiveness using synthetic datasets. We apply
it to detecting early warning signals of the COVID-19 epidemic. We empirically
demonstrate that D-MDL is able to raise early warning signals of events such as
significant increase/decrease of cases. Remarkably, for about $64\%$ of the
events of significant increase of cases in 37 studied countries, our method can
detect warning signals as early as nearly six days on average before the
events, buying considerably long time for making responses. We further relate
the warning signals to the basic reproduction number $R0$ and the timing of
social distancing. The results showed that our method can effectively monitor
the dynamics of $R0$, and confirmed the effectiveness of social distancing at
containing the epidemic in a region. We conclude that our method is a promising

approach fits a single function to all series. For groups of similar time

car manufacturers must tackle in order to provide safe driverless cars. The
high complexity stems from several factors: the multiplicity of vehicles,
embedded systems, use cases, and the very high required level of reliability
for the driving system to be at least as safe as a human driver. In order to
circumvent these issues, large scale simulations reproducing this huge variety
of physical conditions are intensively used to test driverless cars. Therefore,
the validation step produces a massive amount of data, including many
time-indexed ones, to be processed. In this context, building a structure in
the feature space is mandatory to interpret the various scenarios. In this

this workflow, times series are projected onto a common interpolated
low-dimensional frequency space, which allows to optimize the projection basis.
In addition, FunCLBM refines the definition of each latent block by performing
block-wise dimension reduction and feature selection. We propose a SEM-Gibbs
algorithm to infer this model, as well as a dedicated criterion to select the
optimal nested partition. Experiments on both simulated and real-case Renault

research has demonstrated the added prognosis value that becomes available by

time, the ability to estimate the AFB over long-term continuous recordings,
using a deep recurrent neutral network (DRNN) approach. Methods: The models
were developed and evaluated on a large database of p=2,891 patients, totaling
t=68,800 hours of continuous electrocardiography (ECG) recordings acquired at
the University of Virginia heart station. Specifically, 24h beat-to-beat time
series were obtained from a single portable ECG channel. The network, denoted
ArNet, was benchmarked against a gradient boosting (XGB) model, trained on 21

Data were divided into training and test sets, while patients were stratified

provides excellent spectral (5-105nm) and temperature (2-25MK) coverage for AR

only one large AR 11520 was present on the disk. By subtracting the quiet Sun

the 1-300A and astronomical standard ROSAT-PSPC, 3-124A, passbands and compare
these to the magnetic energy injection rate through the photosphere, and to
variations of the solar cycle luminosity. We find that while AR radiative
energy losses are ~100 times smaller than typical magnetic energy injection
rates at the photosphere, they are an order of magnitude larger or similar to

associated policy interventions through detecting early-warning signals in time
series of visits to points of interest (POIs). Complex systems, such as cities,
demonstrate early-warning signals when they approach phase transitions
responding to external perturbation, including crises, policy changes, and
human behavior changes. In urban systems, population visits to POIs represent a
state in the complex systems that are cities. These states may undergo phase
transitions due to population response to pandemic risks and intervention
policies. In this study, we conducted early-warning signal detection on
population visits to POIs to examine population response to pandemic risks. We
examined two early-warning signals, the increase of autocorrelation at-lag-1
and standard deviation, in time series of population visits to POIs in 17
metropolitan cities in the United States of America. The results show that: (1)
early-warning signals for population response to COVID-19 were detected between
February 14 and March 11, 2020 in 17 cities; (2) detected population response
had started prior to shelter-in-place orders in 17 cities; (3) early-warning
signals detected from the essential POIs visits appeared earlier than those
from non-essential POIs; and 4) longer time lags between detected population
response and shelter-in-place orders led to a less decrease in POI visits. The
results show the importance of detecting early-warning signals during crises in

many machine learning application domains. Accurate interpretation of such
prediction outcomes from a machine learning model that explicitly captures
temporal correlations can significantly benefit the domain experts. In this
context, temporal attention has been successfully applied to isolate the
important time steps for the input time series. However, in multivariate time
series problems, spatial interpretation is also critical to understand the
contributions of different variables on the model outputs. We propose a novel
deep learning architecture, called spatiotemporal attention mechanism (STAM)
for simultaneous learning of the most important time steps and variables. STAM
is a causal (i.e., only depends on past inputs and does not use future inputs)
and scalable (i.e., scales well with an increase in the number of variables)
approach that is comparable to the state-of-the-art models in terms of
computational tractability. We demonstrate our models' performance on two
popular public datasets and a domain-specific dataset. When compared with the
baseline models, the results show that STAM maintains state-of-the-art

consecutive strides. The time series of gait parameters are long-range
correlated (statistical persistence). In contrast, when gait is synchronized
with external rhythmic cues, the fluctuation regime is modified to stochastic
oscillations around the target frequency (statistical anti-persistence). To
highlight these two fluctuation modes, the prevalent methodology is the
detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The DFA outcome is the scaling exponent,
which lies between 0.5 and 1 if the time series exhibit long-range
correlations, and below 0.5 if the time series is anti-correlated. A
fundamental assumption for applying DFA is that the analyzed time series
results from a time-invariant generating process. However, a gait time series
may be constituted by an ensemble of sub-segments with distinct fluctuation
regimes (e.g., correlated and anti-correlated). Methods: Several proportions of
correlated and anti-correlated time series were mixed together and then
analyzed through DFA. The original (before mixing) time series were generated
via autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) modelling or
actual gait data. Results: Results evidenced a nonlinear sensitivity of DFA to
the mix of correlated and anti-correlated series. Notably, adding a small
proportion of correlated segments into an anti-correlated time series had
stronger effects than the reverse. Significance: In case of changes in gait
control during a walking trial, the resulting time series may be a patchy
ensemble of several fluctuation regimes. When applying DFA, the scaling
exponent may be misinterpreted. Cued walking studies may be most at risk of
suffering this issue in cases of sporadic synchronization with external cues.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=10000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Background: Human gait exhibits complex fractal fluctuations among\nconsecutive strides.

Reasonable prediction results can assist people in planning and

characteristics of time series, that is, long-term trend and short-term
fluctuation. For example, stock prices will have a long-term upward trend with
the market, but there may be a small decline in the short term. These two
characteristics are often relatively independent of each other. However, the
existing prediction methods often do not distinguish between them, which
reduces the accuracy of the prediction model. In this paper, a MTS forecasting

focus to improve the accuracy of model predictions. They find applications in
time series forecasting in varied scenarios including but not limited to
process industries, health care, and economics where a single model might not
provide optimal performance. It is known that if models selected for data
modelling are distinct (linear/non-linear, static/dynamic) and independent
(minimally correlated models), the accuracy of the predictions is improved.
Various approaches suggested in the literature to weigh the ensemble models use
a static set of weights. Due to this limitation, approaches using a static set
of weights for weighing ensemble models cannot capture the dynamic changes or

exploration and denoising of electroencephalography (EEG) or
magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. In its most common formulation, ICA
assumes that the signal matrix is a noiseless linear mixture of independent
sources that are assumed non-Gaussian. A limitation is that it enforces to
estimate as many sources as sensors or to rely on a detrimental PCA step.
  Methods: We present the Spectral Matching ICA (SMICA) model. Signals are
modelled as a linear mixing of independent sources corrupted by additive noise,
where sources and the noise are stationary Gaussian time series. Thanks to the
Gaussian assumption, the negative log-likelihood has a simple expression as a
sum of divergences between the empirical spectral covariance matrices of the
signals and those predicted by the model. The model parameters can then be
estimated by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
  Results: Experiments on phantom MEG datasets show that SMICA can recover
dipole locations more precisely than usual ICA algorithms or Maxwell filtering
when the dipole amplitude is low. Experiments on EEG datasets show that SMICA
identifies a source subspace which contains sources that have less pairwise
mutual information, and are better explained by the projection of a single
dipole on the scalp.
  Comparison with existing methods: Noiseless ICA models lead to degenerate
likelihood when there are fewer sources than sensors, while SMICA succeeds
without resorting to prior dimension reduction.
  Conclusions: SMICA is a promising alternative to other noiseless ICA models
based on non-Gaussian assumptions.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=10000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Background: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a widespread tool for\nexploration and denoising of electroencephalography (EEG) or\nmagnetoencephalography (MEG) signals.

city, and transportation resources are the main components of urban resources.
Currently, a series of problems with transportation resources such as
unbalanced distribution and road congestion disrupt the scheduling discipline.
Therefore, it is significant to predict travel demand for urban resource
dispatching. Previously, the traditional time series models were used to
forecast travel demand, such as AR, ARIMA and so on. However, the prediction
efficiency of these methods is poor and the training time is too long. In order
to improve the performance, deep learning is used to assist prediction. But
most of the deep learning methods only utilize temporal dependence or spatial

scalar to the vector case is how to estimate the ratios of the variances of
pairwise components of the VAR model. The first method overcomes this
difficulty by requiring the quantisation to be non-symmetric: each component of
the VAR model output is replaced by a binary ""zero"" or a binary ""one"" depending
on whether its value is greater than a strictly positive threshold. Different
components of the VAR model can have different thresholds. As the choice of
these thresholds has a strong influence on the performance, this first method
is best suited for applications where the variance of each time series is
approximately known prior to choosing the corresponding threshold. The second
method relies instead on symmetric quantisations of not only each component of
the VAR model but also on the pairwise differences of the components. These
additional measurements are equivalent to a ranking of the instantaneous VAR

Within the literary texts, a distinction is made between canonical and
non-canonical works. The central hypothesis of the study is that the three text
types (non-literary, literary/canonical and literary/non-canonical) exhibit
systematic differences with respect to structural design features as correlates
of aesthetic responses in readers. To investigate these differences, we
compiled a corpus containing texts of the three categories of interest, the
Jena Textual Aesthetics Corpus. Two aspects of global structure are
investigated, variability and self-similar (fractal) patterns, which reflect
long-range correlations along texts. We use four types of basic observations,
(i) the frequency of POS-tags per sentence, (ii) sentence length, (iii) lexical
diversity in chunks of text, and (iv) the distribution of topic probabilities
in chunks of texts. These basic observations are grouped into two more general
categories, (a) the low-level properties (i) and (ii), which are observed at
the level of the sentence (reflecting linguistic decoding), and (b) the
high-level properties (iii) and (iv), which are observed at the textual level
(reflecting comprehension). The basic observations are transformed into time
series, and these time series are subject to multifractal detrended fluctuation
analysis (MFDFA). Our results show that low-level properties of texts are
better discriminators than high-level properties, for the three text types
under analysis. Canonical literary texts differ from non-canonical ones
primarily in terms of variability. Fractality seems to be a universal feature
of text, more pronounced in non-literary than in literary texts. Beyond the
specific results of the study, we intend to open up new perspectives on the
experimental study of textual aesthetics.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=10000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'This study investigates global properties of literary and non-literary texts.\nWithin the literary texts, a distinction is made between canonical and\nnon-canonical works.

much larger for supergranulation. For granulation and low levels of
supergranulation, the detection rates are good for K and late G stars (if the

of supergranulation leads to a very poor performance, even for K stars; this is
both due to low detection rates and to high levels of false positives, even for
a very dense temporal sampling over ten years. False positive levels estimated

Classical T Tauri stars (cTTs) are pre-main sequence stars
surrounded by an accretion disk. They host a strong magnetic field, and both
magnetospheric accretion and ejection processes develop as the young magnetic
star interacts with its disk. Studying this interaction is a major goal toward
understanding the properties of young stars and their evolution. Aims. The goal
of this study is to investigate the accretion process in the young stellar
system HQ Tau, an intermediate-mass T Tauri star (1.9 M$_{\odot}$). Methods.
The time variability of the system is investigated both photometrically, using
Kepler-K2 and complementary light curves, and from a high-resolution
spectropolarimetric time series obtained with ESPaDOnS at CFHT. Results. The
quasi-sinusoidal Kepler-K2 light curve exhibits a period of 2.424 d, which we
ascribe to the rotational period of the star. The radial velocity of the system
shows the same periodicity, as expected from the modulation of the photospheric
line profiles by surface spots. A similar period is found in the red wing of
several emission lines (e.g., HI, CaII, NaI), due to the appearance of inverse
P Cygni components, indicative of accretion funnel flows. Signatures of
outflows are also seen in the line profiles, some being periodic, others
transient. The polarimetric analysis indicates a complex, moderately strong
magnetic field which is possibly sufficient to truncate the inner disk close to
the corotation radius, r$_{cor}$ $\sim$3.5 R$_{\star}$. Additionally, we report
HQ Tau to be a spectroscopic binary candidate whose orbit remains to be
determined. Conclusions. The results of this study expand upon those previously
reported for low-mass T Tauri stars, as they indicate that the magnetospheric
accretion process may still operate in intermediate-mass pre-main sequence

challenges of infinite-dimensionality with serial dependence and

are subject to errors in the sense that each functional datum arises as the sum
of two uncorrelated components, one dynamic and one white noise. Motivated from

perform unambiguous statistical studies of fundamental plasma processes such as
shocks, magnetic reconnection, waves and turbulence, jets and their
combinations. The majority of available studies have been performed by using
human-driven methods, such as visual data selection or the application of
predefined thresholds to different observable plasma quantities. While
human-driven methods have allowed performing many statistical studies, these
methods are often time-consuming and can introduce important biases. On the
other hand, the recent availability of large, high-quality spacecraft
databases, together with major advances in machine-learning algorithms, can now
allow meaningful applications of machine learning to in-situ plasma data. In
this study, we apply the fully convolutional neural network (FCN) deep
machine-leaning algorithm to the recent Magnetospheric Multi Scale (MMS)
mission data in order to classify ten key plasma regions in near-Earth space
for the period 2016-2019. For this purpose, we use available intervals of time
series for each such plasma region, which were labeled by using human-driven
selective downlink applied to MMS burst data. We discuss several quantitative
parameters to assess the accuracy of both methods. Our results indicate that
the FCN method is reliable to accurately classify labeled time series data
since it takes into account the dynamical features of the plasma data in each
region. We also present good accuracy of the FCN method when applied to
unlabeled MMS data. Finally, we show how this method used on MMS data can be
extended to data from the Cluster mission, indicating that such method can be
successfully applied to any in situ spacecraft plasma database.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=10000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The proper classification of plasma regions in near-Earth space is crucial to\nperform unambiguous statistical studies of fundamental plasma processes such as\nshocks, magnetic reconnection, waves and turbulence, jets and their\ncombinations.

investigate rapid variability in the radio flux density of the BL Lac object
PKS B1144-379 at 6.7 GHz. High-cadence monitoring of this extreme scintillator

2011. We have used structure functions created from the intensity time series
to determine the characteristic timescale of the variability. The
characteristic timescale is consistently observed to increase during certain
periods of each year, demonstrating the annual cycle expected for scintillation
through an interstellar scattering screen. The best-fitting annual cycle model
for each year suggests that the scintillation pattern has an anisotropic
structure and that the upper limit of its scattering screen is at a distance of
~0.84 kpc. Higher anisotropy in some of the annual cycle fits suggests that
changes in the intrinsic source structure might be influencing the variability
timescale. We found a prominent annual cycle is only present in the variability
timescale for certain years where other evidence suggests that the core is
compact. From our measurements, we calculated that the core angular size varied
between 5.65-15.90 $\mu$as (0.05-0.13 pc). The core component was found to be
at its most compact during two flares in the total flux density, which were
observed in 2005 and 2008. We conclude that the long-term variability in the

assets is a key component in the pricing of options. Rough stochastic
volatility models, such as the rough Bergomi model [Bayer, Friz, Gatheral,
Quantitative Finance 16(6), 887-904, 2016], seek to fit observed market data
based on the observation that the log-realized variance behaves like a
fractional Brownian motion with small Hurst parameter, $H < 1/2$, over
reasonable timescales. Both time series data of asset prices and option derived
price data indicate that $H$ often takes values close to $0.1$ or smaller, i.e.
rougher than Brownian Motion. This change greatly improves the fit to time
series data of underlying asset prices as well as to option prices while
maintaining parsimoniousness. However, the non-Markovian nature of the driving
fractional Brownian motion in the rough Bergomi model poses severe challenges
for theoretical and numerical analyses as well as for computational practice.
While the explicit Euler method is known to converge to the solution of the
rough Bergomi model, its strong rate of convergence is only $H$. For a
simplified rough Bergomi model, we prove rate $H + 1/2$ for the weak
convergence of the Euler method and, surprisingly, in the case of quadratic
payoff functions we obtain rate one. Indeed, the problem of weak convergence
for rough Bergomi is very subtle; we provide examples demonstrating that the
rate of convergence for payoff functions well approximated by second-order
polynomials, as weighted by the law of the fractional Brownian motion, may be
hard to distinguish from rate one empirically. Our proof relies on Taylor

The time-dependent coefficients in the POD subspace are propagated by the
recurrent net (closed-loop encoder-decoder updates) and mapped to a
high-dimensional state via the mean flow field and POD basis vectors. This
model is referred as POD-RNN. The second model, referred to as convolution
recurrent autoencoder network (CRAN), employs convolutional neural networks

low-dimensional features from flow field snapshots. The flattened features are
advanced using a recurrent (closed-loop manner) net and up-sampled (transpose

gravitational wave (GW) signals of compact binary coalescences, using
single-interferometer data from LIGO detectors. As novel contribution, we
adopted a resampling white-box approach to advance towards a statistical
understanding of uncertainties intrinsic to CNNs in GW data analysis.
Resampling is performed by repeated $k$-fold cross-validation experiments, and
for a white-box approach, behavior of CNNs is mathematically described in
detail. Through a Morlet wavelet transform, strain time series are converted to
time-frequency images, which in turn are reduced before generating input
datasets. Moreover, to reproduce more realistic experimental conditions, we
worked only with data of non-Gaussian noise and hardware injections, removing
freedom to set signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values in GW templates by hand.
After hyperparameter adjustments, we found that resampling smooths
stochasticity of mini-batch stochastic gradient descend by reducing mean
accuracy perturbations in a factor of $3.6$. CNNs were quite precise to detect
noise but not sensitive enough to recall GW signals, meaning that CNNs are
better for noise reduction than generation of GW triggers. However, applying a
post-analysis, we found that for GW signals of SNR $\geq 21.80$ with H1 data
and SNR $\geq 26.80$ with L1 data, CNNs could remain as tentative alternatives

curves we found that CNNs show much better performances than those of Naive
Bayes and Support Vector Machines models and, with a significance level of

vehicles (UAVs) from radio frequency (RF) fingerprints at the low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
trained with both RF time-series images and the spectrograms of 15 different
off-the-shelf drone controller RF signals. When using time-series signal
images, the CNN extracts features from the signal transient and envelope. As
the SNR decreases, this approach fails dramatically because the information in
the transient is lost in the noise, and the envelope is distorted heavily. In
contrast to time-series representation of the RF signals, with spectrograms, it
is possible to focus only on the desired frequency interval, i.e., 2.4 GHz ISM
band, and filter out any other signal component outside of this band. These
advantages provide a notable performance improvement over the time-series
signals-based methods. To further increase the classification accuracy of the
spectrogram-based CNN, we denoise the spectrogram images by truncating them to
a limited spectral density interval. Creating a single model using spectrogram
images of noisy signals and tuning the CNN model parameters, we achieve a

We use convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\ntrained with both RF time-series images and the spectrograms of 15 different\noff-the-shelf drone controller RF signals. When using time-series signal\nimages, the CNN extracts features from the signal transient and envelope. As\nthe SNR decreases, this approach fails dramatically because the information in\nthe transient is lost in the noise, and the envelope is distorted heavily. In\ncontrast to time-series representation of the RF signals, with spectrograms, it\nis possible to focus only on the desired frequency interval, i.e., 2.4 GHz ISM\nband, and filter out any other signal component outside of this band. These\nadvantages provide a notable performance improvement over the time-series\nsignals-based methods. To further increase the classification accuracy of the\nspectrogram-based CNN, we denoise the spectrogram images by truncating them to\na limited spectral density interval.

studies of known phenomena, like the supernova campaigns that enabled the
discovery of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, as much as through
serendipitous, unexpected discoveries. The discovery of the Jovian moons, and
of interstellar objects like 1I/'Oumuamua forced us to rethink the framework
through which we explain the Universe and develop new theories. Recent surveys,
like the Catalina Realtime-Transient Survey and the Zwicky Transient Facility,
and upcoming ones, like the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time, explore the
parameter space of astrophysical transients at all time scales, from hours to
years, and offer the opportunity to discover new, unexpected phenomena. In this
paper, we investigate strategies to identify novel objects and to contextualize
them within large time-series data sets to facilitate the discovery of new
objects, new classes of objects, and the physical interpretation of their
anomalous nature. We compare tree-based and manifold-learning algorithms for
anomaly detection as they are applied to a data set of light curves from the
Kepler observatory that include the bona fide anomalous Boyajian's star. We
assess the impact of pre-processing and feature engineering schemes and
investigate the astrophysical nature of the objects that our models identify as
anomalous by augmenting the Kepler data with \emph{Gaia} color and luminosity
information. We find that multiple models, used in combination, are a promising

We compare tree-based and manifold-learning algorithms for\nanomaly detection as they are applied to a data set of light curves from the\nKepler observatory that include the bona fide anomalous Boyajian's star. We\nassess the impact of pre-processing and feature engineering schemes and\ninvestigate the astrophysical nature of the objects that our models identify as\nanomalous by augmenting the Kepler data with \\emph{Gaia} color and luminosity\ninformation.

prediction method by automatically learning hidden temporal patterns from

neural network (CNN) architecture.
  Methods: We used three years of medical and pharmacy claims data from 2013 to
2016 from a healthcare insurer, where data from the first two years were used
to build the model to predict costs in the third year. The data consisted of
the multivariate time series of cost, visit and medical features that were
shaped as images of patients' health status (i.e., matrices with time windows
on one dimension and the medical, visit and cost features on the other
dimension). Patients' multivariate time series images were given to a CNN
method with a proposed architecture. After hyper-parameter tuning, the proposed
architecture consisted of three building blocks of convolution and pooling
layers with an LReLU activation function and a customized kernel size at each
layer for healthcare data. The proposed CNN learned temporal patterns became

  Conclusions: Feature learning through the proposed CNN configuration
significantly improved individual-level healthcare cost prediction. The
proposed CNN was able to outperform temporal pattern detection methods that
look for a pre-defined set of pattern shapes, since it is capable of extracting
a variable number of patterns with various shapes. Temporal patterns learned

and engineering. A common challenge is to quantify uncertainties on model
inputs (parameters) that correspond to a quantitative characterization of
uncertainties on observable Quantities of Interest (QoI). To this end, we
consider a stochastic inverse problem (SIP) with a solution described by a
pullback probability measure. We call this an observation-consistent solution,
as its subsequent push-forward through the QoI map matches the observed
probability distribution on model outputs. A distinction is made between QoI
useful for solving the SIP and arbitrary model output data. In dynamical
systems, model output data are often given as a series of state variable
responses recorded over a particular time window. Consequently, the dimension
of output data can easily exceed $\mathcal{O}(1E4)$ or more due to the
frequency of observations, and the correct choice or construction of a QoI from
this data is not self-evident. We present a new framework, Learning Uncertain
Quantities (LUQ), that facilitates the tractable solution of SIPs for dynamical
systems. Given ensembles of predicted (simulated) time series and (noisy)
observed data, LUQ provides routines for filtering data, unsupervised learning
of the underlying dynamics, classifying observations, and feature extraction to
learn the QoI map. Subsequently, time series data are transformed into samples
of the underlying predicted and observed distributions associated with the QoI
so that solutions to the SIP are computable. Following the introduction and
demonstration of LUQ, numerical results from several SIPs are presented for a

convolutional network (FCN) and a texture-based random forest (RF) model to map
urban density in the two morphological dimensions: horizontal (compact, open,
sparse) and vertical (high rise, low rise). We test whether a model trained on

the inclusion of multi-scale contextual information greatly improve the

evolution of galaxies, but our analyses of these are often heuristic and from
simple statistics. We propose a method that discovers the dynamics in space and
time together by finding the most correlated temporal signals in multiple time
series of basis function expansion coefficients and any other data fields of
interest. The method extracts the dominant trends in the spatial variation of
the gravitational field along with any additional data fields through time. The
mathematics of this method is known as multichannel singular spectrum analysis
(M-SSA). In essence, M-SSA is a principal component analysis of the covariance
of time series replicates, each lagged successively by some interval. The
dominant principal component represents the trend that contains the largest
fraction of the correlated signal. The next principal component is orthogonal
to the first and contains the next largest fraction, and so on. Using a suite
of previously analysed simulations, we find that M-SSA describes bar formation
and evolution, including mode coupling and pattern-speed decay. We also analyse
a new simulation tailored to study vertical oscillations of the bar using

Gamma-ray bursts can be located via arrival time signal

other organisms, the study of complex social interactions in an experimentally

predictive tasks, and recurrent models have been widely used for such tasks.
Most common recurrent models assume that time-series data elements are of equal
length and the ordered observations are recorded at regular intervals. However,
real-world time-series data have neither a similar length nor a same number of
observations. They also have missing entries, which hinders the performance of
predictive tasks. In this paper, we approach these issues by presenting a model
for the combined task of imputing and predicting values for the irregularly
observed and varying length time-series data with missing entries. Our proposed
model (Bi-GAN) uses a bidirectional recurrent network in a generative
adversarial setting. The generator is a bidirectional recurrent network that
receives actual incomplete data and imputes the missing values. The
discriminator attempts to discriminate between the actual and the imputed
values in the output of the generator. Our model learns how to impute missing
elements in-between (imputation) or outside of the input time steps
(prediction), hence working as an effective any-time prediction tool for
time-series data. Our method has three advantages to the state-of-the-art
methods in the field: (a) single model can be used for both imputation and
prediction tasks; (b) it can perform prediction task for time-series of varying
length with missing data; (c) it does not require to know the observation and
prediction time window during training which provides a flexible length of
prediction window for both long-term and short-term predictions. We evaluate

Firstly, we\ntest their susceptibility to the mirror-attractor. Secondly, we evaluate their\nperformance on the task of predicting Lorenz data with the mean shifted to\nzero. The short-time prediction is measured with the forecast horizon while the\nlargest Lyapunov exponent and the correlation dimension are used to represent\nthe climate. Finally, the same analysis is repeated on a combined dataset of\nthe Lorenz attractor and the Halvorsen attractor, which we designed to reveal\npotential problems with symmetry. We find that all methods except the output\nbias are able to fully break the symmetry with input shift and quadratic\nreadout performing the best overall.'}","[{'name': 'Joschka Herteux'}, {'name': 'Christoph Räth'}]",{'name': 'Christoph Räth'},Christoph Räth,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0028993', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07103v2', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.07103v2', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'physics.data-an', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'physics.data-an', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.NE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]","14 pages, 10 figures, accepted by chaos",10.1063/5.0028993,,"Chaos 30, 123142 (2020)"

Despite the remarkable performance of representation learning methods in the
analysis of time series, there are still several challenges associated with
these methods ranging from the complex structures of methods, the lack of
generality of solutions, the need for expert knowledge, and large-scale
training datasets. We introduce the piece-wise matching layer that works based
on two levels to address some of the aforementioned challenges. At the first
level, a set of morphological, statistical, and frequency features and
comparative forms of them are computed based on each periodic part and its
neighbors. At the second level, these features are modified by predefined
transformation functions based on a receptive field scenario. Several scenarios
of offline processing, incremental processing, fixed sliding receptive field,
and event-based triggering receptive field can be implemented based on the
choice of length and mechanism of indicating the receptive field. We propose
dynamic time wrapping as a mechanism that indicates a receptive field based on
event triggering tactics. To evaluate the performance of this method in time
series analysis, we applied the proposed layer in two publicly available
datasets of PhysioNet competitions in 2015 and 2017 where the input data is ECG

role-playing games. Players can now let their characters dance along with
specified music clips and even generate fan-made dance videos. Previous works
of this topic consider music-to-dance as a supervised motion generation problem
based on time-series data. However, these methods suffer from limited training
data pairs and the degradation of movements. This paper provides a new
perspective for this task where we re-formulate the translation problem as a
piece-wise dance phrase retrieval problem based on the choreography theory.

interactivity. Considering that the dance motion capture is an expensive and

applications ranging from financial time series to environmental statistics.
However, the topic of modeling the variance function conditionally has not seen
near as much attention as modeling the mean. Volatility models have been used
in specific applications, but these models can be difficult to fit in a
Bayesian setting due to posterior distributions that are challenging to sample
from efficiently. In this work, we introduce a general model for
heteroskedastic data. This approach models the conditional variance in a mixed
model approach as a function of any desired covariates or random effects. We
rely on new distribution theory in order to construct priors that yield fully
conjugate full conditional distributions. Thus, our approach can easily be fit

the gap, this work presents an hybrid network - Wavelet-based Long-Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), namely Wavelet-CNN-LSTM

especial nonlinear data processing method to impute the missing value with the
numerical inversion (NI) method, which combines correlation analysis,
sensitivity analysis, and Random Forest (RF) algorithms. Secondly, a new
forecasting model was proposed to monitor the saturation line, which is the
lifeline of the tailings pond and can directly reflect the stability of the
tailings pond. After using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to decompose
the original saturation line data into 4-layer wavelets and de-noise the data,
the CNN was used to identify and learn the spatial structures in the time
series, followed by LSTM cells for detecting the long-short-term dependence.
Finally, different experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of
our model by comparing it with other state-of-the-art algorithms. The results
show that Wavelet-CNN-LSTM achieves the best score both in mean absolute

dynamics of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on the fly. In contrast to the
conventional sequence-to-sequence mapping scheme, Active Tuning decouples the
RNN's recurrent neural activities from the input stream, using the unfolding
temporal gradient signal to tune the internal dynamics into the data stream. As
a consequence, the model output depends only on its internal hidden dynamics
and the closed-loop feedback of its own predictions; its hidden state is
continuously adapted by means of the temporal gradient resulting from
backpropagating the discrepancy between the signal observations and the model
outputs through time. In this way, Active Tuning infers the signal actively but
indirectly based on the originally learned temporal patterns, fitting the most
plausible hidden state sequence into the observations. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of Active Tuning on several time series prediction benchmarks,
including multiple super-imposed sine waves, a chaotic double pendulum, and
spatiotemporal wave dynamics. Active Tuning consistently improves the
robustness, accuracy, and generalization abilities of all evaluated models.
Moreover, networks trained for signal prediction and denoising can be
successfully applied to a much larger range of noise conditions with the help

In contrast to the\nconventional sequence-to-sequence mapping scheme, Active Tuning decouples the\nRNN's recurrent neural activities from the input stream, using the unfolding\ntemporal gradient signal to tune the internal dynamics into the data stream. As\na consequence, the model output depends only on its internal hidden dynamics\nand the closed-loop feedback of its own predictions; its hidden state is\ncontinuously adapted by means of the temporal gradient resulting from\nbackpropagating the discrepancy between the signal observations and the model\noutputs through time. In this way, Active Tuning infers the signal actively but\nindirectly based on the originally learned temporal patterns, fitting the most\nplausible hidden state sequence into the observations. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of Active Tuning on several time series prediction benchmarks,\nincluding multiple super-imposed sine waves, a chaotic double pendulum, and\nspatiotemporal wave dynamics. Active Tuning consistently improves the\nrobustness, accuracy, and generalization abilities of all evaluated models.\nMoreover, networks trained for signal prediction and denoising can be\nsuccessfully applied to a much larger range of noise conditions with the help\nof Active Tuning. Thus, given a capable time series predictor, Active Tuning\nenhances its online signal filtering, denoising, and reconstruction abilities\nwithout the need for additional training.""}","[{'name': 'Sebastian Otte'}, {'name': 'Matthias Karlbauer'}, {'name': 'Martin V.

obtained during the first two years of solar observations with ALMA, in Band 3

levels of magnetic flux. We perform Fast Fourier and Lomb-Scargle transforms to
measure both the spatial structuring of dominant frequencies and the average

from one dataset to another, which is discussed in terms of the solar regions
captured by the observations (i.e., linked to their underlying magnetic

field concentrations (present inside and/or in the immediate vicinity of the

(with an exception of Halpha line-core intensity) are unaffected by similar

that pointing jitter and high gain antenna moves on top of the detectors'

non-equilibrium system and estimating it directly from time-series data from
experiments is highly desirable. Several approaches have been considered for
stationary dynamics, some of which are based on a variational characterization
of the entropy production rate. However, the issue of obtaining it in the case
of non-stationary dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here, we solve this open
problem by demonstrating that the variational approaches can be generalized to
give the exact value of the entropy production rate even for non-stationary
dynamics. On the basis of this result, we develop an efficient algorithm that
estimates the entropy production rate continuously in time by using machine
learning techniques, and validate our numerical estimates using analytically

time series of dMe flare stars and other stellar sources. Such periodic
signals, observed within quiescent phases (i.e., devoid of larger-scale
microflare or flare activity), range in period from $1-1000$ seconds and hence
have been tentatively linked to ubiquitous $p$-mode oscillations generated in
the convective layers of the star. As such, most interpretations for the
observed periodicities have been framed in terms of magneto-hydrodynamic wave
behavior. However, we propose that a series of continuous nanoflares, based
upon a power-law distribution, can provide a similar periodic signal in the
associated time series. Adapting previous statistical analyses of solar
nanoflare signals, we find the first statistical evidence for stellar nanoflare
signals embedded within the noise envelope of M-type stellar lightcurves.
Employing data collected by the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS), we find
evidence for stellar nanoflare activity demonstrating a flaring power-law index
of $3.25 \pm 0.20 $, alongside a decay timescale of $200 \pm 100$ s. We also
find that synthetic time series, consistent with the observations of dMe flare
star lightcurves, are capable of producing quasi-periodic signals in the same
frequency range as $p$-mode signals, despite being purely comprised of
impulsive signatures. Phenomena traditionally considered a consequence of wave
behaviour may be described by a number of high frequency but discrete nanoflare
energy events. This new physical interpretation presents a novel diagnostic
capability, by linking observed periodic signals to given nanoflare model

dynamic optimization problems in an almost model-free way by maximizing a
reward function in state and action spaces. This property makes it an exciting
area of research for financial problems. Asset allocation, where the goal is to
obtain the weights of the assets that maximize the rewards in a given state of
the market considering risk and transaction costs, is a problem easily framed
using a reinforcement learning framework. It is first a prediction problem for
expected returns and covariance matrix and then an optimization problem for
returns, risk, and market impact. Investors and financial researchers have been
working with approaches like mean-variance optimization, minimum variance, risk
parity, and equally weighted and several methods to make expected returns and
covariance matrices' predictions more robust. This paper demonstrates the
application of reinforcement learning to create a financial model-free solution
to the asset allocation problem, learning to solve the problem using time
series and deep neural networks. We demonstrate this on daily data for the top
24 stocks in the US equities universe with daily rebalancing. We use a deep
reinforcement model on US stocks using different architectures. We use Long
Short Term Memory networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural
Networks and compare them with more traditional portfolio management. The Deep
Reinforcement Learning approach shows better results than traditional
approaches using a simple reward function and only being given the time series

stocks, i.e. Goldman Sachs (GS) and General Electric (GE). In order to forecast
stock prices, we used a long short-term memory (LSTM) model in which we
inputted the prices of two other stocks that lie in rather close correlation
with GS. Other models such as ARIMA were used as benchmark. Empirical results
manifest the practical challenges when using LSTM for forecasting stocks. One
of the main upheavals was a recurring lag which we called ""forecasting lag"".
  The second purpose is to develop a more general and objective perspective on
the task of time series forecasting so that it could be applied to assist in an
arbitrary that of forecasting by ANNs. Thus, attempts are made for
distinguishing previous works by certain criteria (introduced by a review paper
written by Ahmed Tealab) so as to summarise those including effective
information. The summarised information is then unified and expressed through a
common terminology that can be applied to different steps of a time series
forecasting task.
  The last but not least purpose of this thesis is to elaborate on a
mathematical framework on which ANNs are based. We are going to use the
framework introduced in the book ""Neural Networks in Mathematical Framework"" by
Anthony L. Caterini in which the structure of a generic neural network is

using advanced tools like neural networks in their empirical research. In this
paper, we propose a class of interpretable neural network models that can
achieve both high prediction accuracy and interpretability. The model can be
written as a simple function of a regularized number of interpretable features,
which are outcomes of interpretable functions encoded in the neural network.
Researchers can design different forms of interpretable functions based on the
nature of their tasks. In particular, we encode a class of interpretable
functions named persistent change filters in the neural network to study time
series cross-sectional data. We apply the model to predicting individual's
monthly employment status using high-dimensional administrative data. We
achieve an accuracy of 94.5% in the test set, which is comparable to the best
performed conventional machine learning methods. Furthermore, the
interpretability of the model allows us to understand the mechanism that
underlies the prediction: an individual's employment status is closely related

implement and extraordinarily successful for predicting material failure times.
However, it neglects memory effects and time-ordering dependence, and therefore
runs into difficulties dealing with highly intermittent or transient stochastic
loads with heavy tailed distributions. Such loads appear frequently in a wide
range of applications in ocean and mechanical engineering, such as wind
turbines and offshore structures. In this work we employ the Serebrinsky-Ortiz
cohesive envelope model for material fatigue to characterize the effects of

Subsequently, we consider the case of stochastic intermittent loads with given
statistical characteristics. To overcome the need for expensive Monte-Carlo
simulations, we formulate the fatigue life as an up-crossing problem of the
coherent envelope. Assuming statistical independence for the large intermittent
spikes and using probabilistic arguments we derive closed expressions for the
up-crossing properties of the coherent envelope and obtain analytical
approximations for the probability mass function of the failure time. The
analytical expressions are derived directly in terms of the probability density
function of the load, as well as the coherent envelope. We examine the accuracy
of the analytical approximations and compare the predicted failure time with
the standard rainflow algorithm for various loads. Finally, we use the

corona, we analyzed ultraviolet (UV) spectral line observations acquired on
both the east and west limbs at 1.7 $R_{\odot}$ by SOHO/UVCS during the solar
minimum preceding solar cycle 23. To obtain a reliable and statistically robust
picture of the rotational profile, we used a set of simultaneous 400-day long
spectral line intensities of five different spectral lines: O VI 1032 A, O VI
1037 A, Si XII 499 A, Si XII 521 A, and H I 1216 A, which are routinely
observed by UVCS. The data were analyzed by means of two different techniques:
the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram (GLS) and a multivariate data-adaptive
technique called multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA). Among many
other positive outcomes, this latter method is unique in its ability to
recognize common oscillatory modes between the five time series observed at
both limbs. The latitudinal rotation profile obtained in this work emphasizes
that the low-latitude region of the UV corona (about $\pm 20^{\circ}$ from the
solar equator) exhibits differential rotation, while the higher-latitude
structures do rotate quasi-rigidly. The differential rotation rate of the solar
corona as evinced at low-latitudes is consistent with the rotational profile of
the near-surface convective zone of the Sun, suggesting that the rotation of
the corona at 1.7 $R_{\odot}$ is linked to intermediate-scale magnetic bipole
structures anchored near 0.99 $R_{\odot}$. The quasi-rigid rotation rate found
at mid and high latitudes is instead attributed to the influence of large-scale
coronal structures linked to the rigidly rotating coronal holes. We further
suggest that the methodology presented in this paper could represent a
milestone for future investigations on differential rotation rates when dealing

modeling large collections of time-series. However, these techniques explicitly

spectroscopic observations of this object in the ultraviolet provided evidence
that it hosts a large and dense circumstellar magnetosphere. Follow-up
observations obtained with the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} not only confirm
that previous inference, but also suggest that NGC 1624-2's magnetosphere has a
complex structure. Furthermore, an expanded spectropolarimetric time series

Measles vaccination through routine immunization (RI) programs in high-burden

Supplementary immunization activities (SIA) in the form of vaccination
campaigns are therefore implemented to prevent measles outbreaks by reducing
the size of the susceptible population. The SIA efficacy, defined as the
fraction of susceptible population immunized by an SIA, is a critical metric
for assessing campaign effectiveness. We propose a discrete-time hidden Markov
model for estimating SIA efficacy and forecasting future incidence trends using
reported measles incidence data. Our approach extends the time-series
susceptible-infected-recovered (TSIR) framework by adding a model component to
capture the impact of SIAs on the susceptible population. It also accounts for
under-reporting and its associated uncertainty via a two-stage estimation
procedure with uncertainty propagation. The proposed model can be used to
estimate the underlying susceptible population dynamics, assess how many
susceptible people were immunized by past SIAs, and forecast incidence trends

investigated using time-dependent Generalized Hurst Exponents (GHE), $H_q$, for

different systems. In this work, we propose a general domain adaptation (DA)
framework that tackles two categories of discrepancies in EHRs collected from

representation across all systems} through an adversarial learning process,
while also allocating a domain-specific model for each system to extract local
latent representations that cannot and should not be unified across systems.
Moreover, our proposed framework is based on variational recurrent neural
network (VRNN) because of its ability to capture complex temporal dependencies
and handling missing values in time-series data. We evaluate our framework for
early diagnosis of an extremely challenging condition, septic shock, using two
real-world EHRs from distinct medical systems in the U.S. The results show that

A relevance sub-network, applied on the output of\nfirst layer of a convolutional neural network model operating on raw speech\nsignals, acts as an acoustic filterbank (FB) layer with relevance weighting. A\nsimilar relevance sub-network applied on the second convolutional layer\nperforms modulation filterbank learning with relevance weighting. The full\nacoustic model consisting of relevance sub-networks, convolutional layers and\nfeed-forward layers is trained for a speech recognition task on noisy and\nreverberant speech in the Aurora-4, CHiME-3 and VOiCES datasets. The proposed\nrepresentation learning framework is also applied for the task of sound\nclassification in the UrbanSound8K dataset. A detailed analysis of the\nrelevance weights learned by the model reveals that the relevance weights\ncapture information regarding the underlying speech/audio content. In addition,\nspeech recognition and sound classification experiments reveal that the\nincorporation of relevance weighting in the neural network architecture\nimproves the performance significantly.'}","[{'name': 'Purvi Agrawal'}, {'name': 'Sriram Ganapathy'}]",{'name': 'Sriram Ganapathy'},Sriram Ganapathy,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TASLP.2020.3030489', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.02136v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.02136v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'eess.AS', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'eess.AS', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.SD', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2011.00721,10.1109/TASLP.2020.3030489,,"IEEE Transactions and Audio, Speech and Language Processing, Vol.

planets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars with radial velocity
technics. Astrometry is in principle less sensitive to stellar activity because
the situation is more favourable: the stellar astrometric signal is expected to
be fainter than the planetary astrometric signal compared to radial velocities.
We quantify the effect of stellar activity on high-precision astrometry when
Earth-mass planets are searched for in the habitable zone around old
main-sequence solar-type stars. We used a very large set of magnetic activity
synthetic time series to characterise the properties of the stellar astrometric
signal. We then studied the detectability of exoplanets based on different
approaches: first based on the theoretical level of false positives derived
from the synthetic time series, and then with blind tests for old main-sequence
F6-K4 stars. The amplitude of the signal can be up to a few times the solar
value depending on the assumptions made for activity level, spectral type, and
spot contrast. The detection rates for 1 MEarth planets are very good, however,
with extremely low false-positive rates in the habitable zone for stars in the
F6-K4 range at 10 pc. The standard false-alarm probability using classical
bootstrapping on the time series strongly overestimates the false-positive
level. This affects the detection rates. We conclude that if technological
challenges can be overcome and very high precision is reached, astrometry is
much more suitable for detecting Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone
around nearby solar-type stars than radial velocity, and detection rates are
much higher for this range of planetary masses and periods when astrometric
techniques are used than with radial velocity techniques.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=10000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Stellar activity strongly affects and may prevent the detection of Earth-mass\nplanets in the habitable zone of solar-type stars with radial velocity\ntechnics.

event was below an SNR threshold for any detector in the network. The use of
SNRs from subthreshold events can meaningfully decrease the area of the 90%

(SPOD): low-rank reconstruction, denoising, frequency-time analysis, and
prewhitening are demonstrated on large-eddy simulation data of a turbulent jet.
SPOD-based low-rank reconstruction can be performed by direct inversion of a
truncated SPOD. This spectral inversion problem, however, is ambiguous since
SPOD relies on spectral estimation. We demonstrate SPOD-based flow field
reconstruction using direct inversion of the SPOD algorithm (frequency-domain
approach) and propose an alternative approach based on projection of the time
series data onto the modes (time-domain approach). While the SPOD optimally
represents the flow in a statistical sense, the time-domain approach seeks an
optimal reconstruction of each instantaneous flow field. We further propose a
SPOD-based denoising strategy that is based on hard-thresholding of the SPOD
eigenvalues. The proposed strategy achieves significant noise reduction while
facilitating drastic data compression. In contrast to standard methods of
frequency-time analysis such as wavelet transform, a proposed SPOD-based
approach yields a spectrogram that characterizes the temporal evolution of
spatially coherent flow structures. In the frequency-domain, time-varying
expansion coefficients can be obtained by basing the SPOD on a sliding window.
This approach, however, is computationally intractable, and an alternative
strategy based on convolution in the time-domain is presented. When applied to
the turbulent jet data, SPOD-based frequency-time analysis reveals that the
intermittent occurrence of large-scale coherent structures is directly
associated with high-energy events. This work suggests that the time-domain

prediction model capturing controlled system dynamics, ii) receding horizon

architecture does not require the system dynamics model to synthesize the

the control policy to track the distribution of reference signals and handle

must be made about both parts of the system. If the signal process is
incorrectly specified, our predictions using this model may generalise poorly;
similarly, if the noise process is incorrectly specified, we can attribute too
much or too little observed variation to the signal. With little justification,
independent Gaussian noise is typically chosen, which defines a statistical

develops two criteria for such a task for tensor factor models where the signal

the gap between the true smallest non-zero eigenvalue and the zero eigenvalues
of a functional of the population version of the auto-cross-covariances of the
tensor time series using their sample versions. As sample size and tensor
dimension increase, such a gap increases under regularity conditions, resulting
in consistency of the rank estimator. The criteria are built upon the existing
non-iterative and iterative estimation procedures of tensor factor model,
yielding different performances. We provide sufficient conditions and
convergence rate for the consistency of the criteria as the sample size $T$ and
the dimensions of the observed tensor time series go to infinity. The results
include the vector factor models as special cases, with an additional
convergence rates. The results also include the cases when there exist factors
with different signal strength. In addition, the convergence rates of the
eigenvalue estimators are established. Simulation studies provide promising
finite sample performance for the two criteria.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=10000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Factor model is an appealing and effective analytic tool for high-dimensional\ntime series, with a wide range of applications in economics, finance and\nstatistics.

The new criteria are designed to locate\nthe gap between the true smallest non-zero eigenvalue and the zero eigenvalues\nof a functional of the population version of the auto-cross-covariances of the\ntensor time series using their sample versions. As sample size and tensor\ndimension increase, such a gap increases under regularity conditions, resulting\nin consistency of the rank estimator. The criteria are built upon the existing\nnon-iterative and iterative estimation procedures of tensor factor model,\nyielding different performances. We provide sufficient conditions and\nconvergence rate for the consistency of the criteria as the sample size $T$ and\nthe dimensions of the observed tensor time series go to infinity. The results\ninclude the vector factor models as special cases, with an additional\nconvergence rates. The results also include the cases when there exist factors\nwith different signal strength. In addition, the convergence rates of the\neigenvalue estimators are established. Simulation studies provide promising\nfinite sample performance for the two criteria.'}","[{'name': 'Yuefeng Han'}, {'name': 'Cun-Hui Zhang'}, {'name': 'Rong Chen'}]",{'name': 'Rong Chen'},Rong Chen,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.07131v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07131v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'stat.ME', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'stat.ME', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,,

High-Frequency Radar system, based on the identification of abnormal surface
current patterns. The detection occurred in the absence of any reported seismic
event but coincided with a strong atmospheric perturbation, which qualified the
event as meteo-tsunami. We re-analyze this case in the light of a new radar
signal processing method which was designed recently for inverting fast-varying
sea surface currents from the complex voltage time series received on the
antennas. This method, based on an Auto-regressive modeling combined with a
Maximum Entropy Method, yields a dramatic improvement in both the
Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the quality of the surface current estimation for
very short integration time. This makes it possible to evidence the propagation
of a sharp wave front of surface current during the event and to map its
magnitude and arrival time over the radar coverage. We show that the amplitude
and speed of the inferred residual current do not comply with a Proudman
resonance mechanism but are consistent with the propagation of a low-pressure
atmospheric front and wind vectors as revealed by satellite imagery. This
indicates that the event that triggered a tsunami alert is more likely a storm
surge than a true meteo-tsunami. Beyond this specific case, another outcome of

detection. In a general change-point setting, we provide a generic algorithm
for aggregating local homogeneity tests into an estimator of change-points in a

of test directly translate into detection properties of the change-point
estimator. This generic scheme is then applied to the problem of possibly

domains. Existing models rely on classical statistical methods to predict
future values based on previously observed numerical information. Yet,
practitioners often rely on visualizations such as charts and plots to reason
about their predictions. Inspired by the end-users, we re-imagine the topic by
creating a framework to produce visual forecasts, similar to the way humans
intuitively do. In this work, we take a novel approach by leveraging advances
in deep learning to extend the field of time series forecasting to a visual

Precise, automated and computationally inexpensive methods to derive physical
parameters from light curves are needed to cope with the large influx of these
data from space-based missions such as Kepler and TESS. Here we present a new
methodology which we call The Swan, a fast, generalizable and effective
approach for deriving stellar surface gravity ($\log g$) for main sequence,
subgiant and red giant stars from Kepler light curves using local linear
regression on the full frequency content of Kepler long cadence power spectra.
With this inexpensive data-driven approach, we recover $\log g$ to a precision
of $\sim$0.02 dex for 13,822 stars with seismic $\log g$ values between 0.2-4.4
dex, and $\sim$0.11 dex for 4,646 stars with Gaia derived $\log g$ values

granulation is difficult to detect in many cool main sequence stars

$\log g$ measurements with Gaia radii, we derive empirical masses for 4,646
subgiant and main sequence stars with a median precision of $\sim$7%. Finally,
we demonstrate that our method can be used to recover $\log g$ to a similar

many countries. In Europe, the virus spread slowed considerably in the late
spring due to strict lockdown, but a second wave of the pandemic grew
throughout the fall. In this study, we first reconstruct the time evolution of
the effective reproduction numbers ${\cal R}(t)$ for each country by
integrating the equations of the classic SIR model. We cluster countries based
on the estimated ${\cal R}(t)$ through a suitable time series dissimilarity.
The result suggests that simple dynamical mechanisms determine how countries
respond to changes in COVID-19 case counts. Inspired by these results, we
extend the SIR model to include a social response to explain the number $X(t)$
of new confirmed daily cases. As a first-order model, we assume that the social
response is on the form $d_t{\cal R}=-\nu (X-X^*)$, where $X^*$ is a threshold
for response. The response rate $\nu$ depends on whether $X^*$ is below or
above this threshold, on three parameters $\nu_1,\;\nu_2,\,\nu_3,$, and on $t$.
When $X<X^*$, $\nu= \nu_1$, describes the effect of relaxed intervention when
the incidence rate is low. When $X>X^*$, $\nu=\nu_2\exp{(-\nu_3t)}$, models the
impact of interventions when incidence rate is high. The parameter $\nu_3$
represents the fatigue, i.e., the reduced effect of intervention as time
passes. The proposed model reproduces typical evolving patterns of COVID-19
epidemic waves observed in many countries. Estimating the parameters
$\nu_1,\,\nu_2,\,\nu_3$ and initial conditions, such as ${\cal R}_0$, for
different countries helps to identify important dynamics in their social

still shrouded in mystery, as the rare nature of these events makes them
difficult to analyze with traditional methods. Modern data mining and machine
learning methods provide a promising way out, but they typically rely on the
availability of massive amounts of well-cleaned data.
  To facilitate the application of such data-hungry methods to surface ocean
waves, we developed FOWD, a freely available wave dataset and processing
framework. FOWD describes the conversion of raw observations into a catalogue
that maps characteristic sea state parameters to observed wave quantities.
Specifically, we employ a running window approach that respects the
non-stationary nature of the oceans, and extensive quality control to reduce
bias in the resulting dataset.
  We also supply a reference Python implementation of the FOWD processing
toolkit, which we use to process the entire CDIP buoy data catalogue containing
over 4 billion waves. In a first experiment, we find that, when the full
elevation time series is available, surface elevation kurtosis and maximum wave
height are the strongest univariate predictors for rogue wave activity. When

observation period. Even if the waveform in the source frame is monochromatic,
we will observe the waveform with modulated frequencies due to the motion of
the detector. If the source location is unknown, a lot of templates having
different sky positions are required to demodulate the frequency, and the
required huge computational cost restricts the applicable parameter region of
coherent search. In this work, we propose and examine a new method to select
candidates, which reduces the cost of coherent search by following-up only the
selected candidates. As a first step, we consider an idealized situation in
which only a single-detector having 100\% duty cycle is available and its
detector noise is approximated by the stationary Gaussian noise. Also, we
assume the signal has no spindown and the polarization angle, the inclination
angle, and the initial phase are fixed to be $\psi=0$, $\cos\iota=1$, and
$\phi_0=0$, and they are treated as known parameters. We combine several
methods: 1) the short-time Fourier transform with the re-sampled data such that
the Earth motion for the source is canceled in some reference direction, 2) the
excess power search in the Fourier transform of the time series obtained by

of the 22-Myr M1 star AU Microscopii (Au Mic) collected with the
high-resolution $YJHK$ (0.98-2.35 $\mu$m) spectropolarimeter SPIRou from 2019
September 18 to November 14. Our radial velocity (RV) time-series exhibits
activity-induced fluctuations of 45 m/s RMS, about three times smaller than
those measured in the optical domain, that we filter using Gaussian Process
Regression. We report a 3.9$\sigma$-detection of the recently-discovered 8.46-d
transiting planet AU Mic b, with an estimated mass of $17.1^{+4.7}_{-4.5}$
M$_{\odot}$ and a bulk density of $1.3 \pm 0.4$ g/cm$^{-3}$, inducing a RV
signature of semi-amplitude $K=8.5^{+2.3}_{-2.2}$ m/s in the spectrum of its
host star. A consistent detection is independently obtained when we
simultaneously image stellar surface inhomogeneities and estimate the planet
parameters with Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI). Using ZDI, we invert the time
series of unpolarized and circularly-polarized spectra into surface brightness
and large-scale magnetic maps. We find a mainly poloidal and axisymmetric field
of 475 G, featuring, in particular, a dipole of 450 G tilted at 19{\deg} to the
rotation axis. Moreover, we detect a strong differential rotation of d$\Omega =
0.167 \pm 0.009$ rad/d shearing the large-scale field, about twice stronger
than that shearing the brightness distribution, suggesting that both
observables probe different layers of the convective zone. Even though we
caution that more RV measurements are needed to accurately pin down the planet
mass, AU Mic b already appears as a prime target for constraining planet
formation models, studying the interactions with the surrounding debris disk,
and characterizing its atmosphere with upcoming space- and ground-based
missions.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=10000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We present a velocimetric and spectropolarimetric analysis of 27 observations\nof the 22-Myr M1 star AU Microscopii (Au Mic) collected with the\nhigh-resolution $YJHK$ (0.98-2.35 $\\mu$m) spectropolarimeter SPIRou from 2019\nSeptember 18 to November 14.

a frequency-dependent propagation delay. Variations in the magnitude of this
effect lead to an additional source of red noise in pulsar timing experiments,
including pulsar timing arrays that aim to detect nanohertz gravitational
waves.
  We aim to quantify the time-variable dispersion with much improved precision
and characterise the spectrum of these variations.
  We use the pulsar timing technique to obtain highly precise dispersion
measure (DM) time series. Our dataset consists of observations of 36
millisecond pulsars, which were observed for up to 7.1 years with the LOFAR
telescope at a centre frequency of ~150 MHz. Seventeen of these sources were
observed with a weekly cadence, while the rest were observed at monthly
cadence.
  We achieve a median DM precision of the order of 10^-5 cm^-3 pc for a
significant fraction of our sources. We detect significant variations of the DM
in all pulsars with a median DM uncertainty of less than 2x10^-4 cm^-3 pc. The
noise contribution to pulsar timing experiments at higher frequencies is
calculated to be at a level of 0.1-10 us at 1.4 GHz over a timespan of a few
years, which is in many cases larger than the typical timing precision of 1 us
or better that PTAs aim for. We found no evidence for a dependence of DM on
radio frequency for any of the sources in our sample.
  The DM time series we obtained using LOFAR could in principle be used to
correct higher-frequency data for the variations of the dispersive delay.
However, there is currently the practical restriction that pulsars tend to
provide either highly precise times of arrival (ToAs) at 1.4 GHz or a high DM
precision at low frequencies, but not both, due to spectral properties.
Combining the higher-frequency ToAs with those from LOFAR to measure the
infinite-frequency ToA and DM would improve the result.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=10000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Radio pulses from pulsars are affected by plasma dispersion, which results in\na frequency-dependent propagation delay.

point interventions is becoming increasingly common as more health and activity
data are collected and digitized via wearables, social media, and electronic
health records. Such time series may involve hundreds or thousands of
irregularly sampled observations. One common analysis approach is to simplify
such time series by first discretizing them into sequences before applying a
discrete-time estimation method that adjusts for time-dependent confounding. In
certain settings, this discretization results in sequences with many time
points; however, the empirical properties of longitudinal causal estimators
have not been systematically compared on long sequences. We compare three

motion. Successful solutions have many applications in human tracking, HCI, and
graphics. Most previous work focuses on predicting a time series of future 3D
joint locations given a sequence 3D joints from the past. This Euclidean
formulation generally works better than predicting pose in terms of joint
rotations. Body joint locations, however, do not fully constrain 3D human pose,
leaving degrees of freedom undefined, making it hard to animate a realistic
human from only the joints. Note that the 3D joints can be viewed as a sparse
point cloud. Thus the problem of human motion prediction can be seen as point
cloud prediction. With this observation, we instead predict a sparse set of
locations on the body surface that correspond to motion capture markers. Given
such markers, we fit a parametric body model to recover the 3D shape and pose
of the person. These sparse surface markers also carry detailed information
about human movement that is not present in the joints, increasing the
naturalness of the predicted motions. Using the AMASS dataset, we train MOJO,
which is a novel variational autoencoder that generates motions from latent
frequencies. MOJO preserves the full temporal resolution of the input motion,
and sampling from the latent frequencies explicitly introduces high-frequency
components into the generated motion. We note that motion prediction methods
accumulate errors over time, resulting in joints or markers that diverge from
true human bodies. To address this, we fit SMPL-X to the predictions at each
time step, projecting the solution back onto the space of valid bodies. These
valid markers are then propagated in time. Experiments show that our method

September 6th. One MFR has positive magnetic twist which is a different sign
from other two MFRs. Since the temporal evolution of the magnetic flux of the
MFR accumulating the positive twist is consistent with the profile of the GOES
X-ray flux well observed from September 4th to 6th, we suggest that the
formation of the MFR having the positive twist is closely related to the
occurrence of the M-class flares including an M5.5 flare. We further found a
magnetic null in the magnetic field surrounding the MFRs, in particular, above
the MFR having positive twist before the M5.5 flare which is the largest
M-flare observed during this period. By comparing with the AIA 1600 angstrom

spacing between observations, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We
propose to use neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) in combination
with RNNs to classify crop types in irregularly spaced image sequences. The
resulting ODE-RNN models consist of two steps: an update step, where a
recurrent unit assimilates new input data into the model's hidden state; and a
prediction step, in which NODE propagates the hidden state until the next
observation arrives. The prediction step is based on a continuous
representation of the latent dynamics, which has several advantages. At the
conceptual level, it is a more natural way to describe the mechanisms that
govern the phenological cycle. From a practical point of view, it makes it
possible to sample the system state at arbitrary points in time, such that one
can integrate observations whenever they are available, and extrapolate beyond
the last observation. Our experiments show that ODE-RNN indeed improves
classification accuracy over common baselines such as LSTM, GRU, and temporal
convolution. The gains are most prominent in the challenging scenario where

The SMADI time-series\nwere compared with state-of-the-art drought indices over the Iberian Peninsula.\nResults show a good agreement between SMADI and the Crop Moisture Index (CMI)\nretrieved at five weather stations (with correlation coefficient, R from -0.64\nto -0.79) and the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) at the Soil Moisture\nMeasurement Stations Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS)\n(R=-0.83). Some preliminary tests were also made over the continental United\nStates using the Vegetation Drought Response Index (VegDRI), with very\nencouraging results regarding the spatial occurrence of droughts during summer\nseasons. Additionally, SMADI allowed to identify distinctive patterns of\nregional drought over the Indian Peninsula in spring of 2012.

Bayesian statistics and generally yields efficient and accurate parameter
estimates. However, GPs are typically used for inverse modeling based on
concurrent observations and in situ measurements only. Very often a forward
model encoding the well-understood physical relations between the state vector

ordinary differential equations to blend data-driven modeling and physical

example, the principle of exploiting sparse optimization such as compressive
sensing to find the equations of nonlinear dynamical systems from data was
articulated in 2011 by the Nonlinear Dynamics Group at Arizona State
University. This article presents a brief review of the recent progress in this

and system collapse, inferring the full topology of complex networks of
dynamical oscillators and social networks hosting evolutionary game dynamics,
and identifying partial differential equations for spatiotemporal dynamical

worldwide. The effects of wildfires are heterogeneous, meaning that the
magnitude of their effects depends on many factors such as geographical region,
climate and land cover/vegetation type. Yet, which areas are more affected by
these events remains unclear. Here we present a novel application of the
Generalised Synthetic Control (GSC) method that enables quantification and
prediction of vegetation changes due to wildfires through a time-series
analysis of in situ and satellite remote sensing data. We apply this method to
medium to large wildfires ($>$ 1000 acres) in California throughout a time-span
of two decades (1996--2016). The method's ability for estimating counterfactual
vegetation characteristics for burned regions is explored in order to quantify
abrupt system changes. We find that the GSC method is better at predicting
vegetation changes than the more traditional approach of using nearby regions
to assess wildfire impacts. We evaluate the GSC method by comparing its
predictions of spectral vegetation indices to observations during pre-wildfire
periods and find improvements in correlation coefficient from $R^2 = 0.66$ to
$R^2 = 0.93$ in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), from $R^2 =
0.48$ to $R^2 = 0.81$ for Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR), and from $R^2 = 0.49$ to
$R^2 = 0.85$ for Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). Results show
greater changes in NDVI, NBR, and NDMI post-fire on regions classified as
having a lower Burning Index. The GSC method also reveals that wildfire effects
on vegetation can last for more than a decade post-wildfire, and in some cases
never return to their previous vegetation cycles within our study period.

Additionally, we show how Random Matrix Theory can provide guidance for
automatic tuning of the hyperparameter which characterizes the time scale for
the dynamics of the estimator. By attenuating the noise from both the

the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The optimal interpolator exploits GEE
ability to ingest large amounts of data (Landsat climatologies) and uses simple
