O-type supergiants with emission lines (OIf+) are considered to be intermediate
between these two classes. The scope of this paper is to investigate the
spectral variability of three Of+ supergiants. We constituted spectral time
series of unprecedented quality for our targets (~ 200 spectra in total),
essentially in the blue domain, covering time-scales from a few hours up to a
few years. Time Variance Spectrum (TVS) and Fourier analyses were performed in
order to characterize their spectral variability. We report on a correlated
significant line profile variability in the prominent He II \lambda 4686 and
H\beta lines most likely related to the strong stellar winds. The variability
pattern is similar for the three stars investigated (HD14947, HD15570 and
HD16691), and the main differences are more quantitative than qualitative.
However, the reported time-scales are somewhat different, and the most striking
variability pattern is reported for HD16691. We did not find any clear evidence
for binarity, and we focus mainly on an interpretation based on a single star
scenario. We show that the behaviour of the three stars investigated in this
study present strong similarities, pointing to a putative common scenario, even
though a few differences should be noted. Our preferred interpretation scheme
is that of Large Scale Corotating Structures modulating the profile of the
lines that are produced in the strong stellar wind.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The transition from early Of stars to WN type objects is poorly understood.\nO-type supergiants with emission lines (OIf+) are considered to be intermediate\nbetween these two classes.

bioinformatics programs used today. Applications range widely from comparative
gene prediction to time-series analyses of micro-array data. The parameters of
the underlying models need to be adjusted for specific data sets, for example
the genome of a particular species, in order to maximize the prediction
accuracy. Computationally efficient algorithms for parameter training are thus
key to maximizing the usability of a wide range of bioinformatics applications.
  Results: We introduce two computationally efficient training algorithms, one
for Viterbi training and one for stochastic expectation maximization (EM)
training, which render the memory requirements independent of the sequence
length. Unlike the existing algorithms for Viterbi and stochastic EM training
which require a two-step procedure, our two new algorithms require only one
step and scan the input sequence in only one direction. We also implement these
two new algorithms and the already published linear-memory algorithm for EM
training into the hidden Markov model compiler HMM-Converter and examine their

use the two algorithms in order to make Viterbi training and stochastic EM

sequences. The two new algorithms have the added advantage of being easier to

on time series data collected from 20 hours of observations spread over 3
successive nights with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter. Our tomographic imaging
technique applied to time series of rotationally modulated circularly polarized
profiles reveals an axisymmetric large-scale poloidal magnetic field on the M4
dwarf. We then apply a synthetic spectrum fitting technique for measuring the
average magnetic flux on the star. The flux measured in G 164-31 is Bf =
3.2+-0.4 kG, which is significantly greater than the average value of 0.68 kG
determined from the imaging technique. The difference indicates that a
significant fraction of the stellar magnetic energy is stored in small-scale
structures at the surface of G 164-31. Our H_alpha emission light curve shows
evidence for rotational modulation suggesting the presence of localized
structure in the chromosphere of this M dwarf. The radius of the M4 dwarf
derived from the rotational period and the projected equatorial velocity is at

different time series $X_{t}$. The branching ratio $b_x$ is defined as $b_x=

that the previous one is equal to $x$, so $\xi_x=\{X_{t+1}|X_t=x\}$. If
$b_x>1$, the process is on average supercritical when the signal is equal to
$x$, while if $b_x<1$, it is subcritical. For stock prices we find $b_x=1$

with heterogeneous arbitrageurs and positive feedbacks leading to
self-reinforcing transient stochastic faster-than-exponential price dynamics.
As a result of the nonlinear feedbacks, the termination of a bubble is found to
be characterized by a finite-time singularity in the bubble price formation
process ending at some potential critical time $\tilde{t}_c$, which follows a
mean-reversing stationary dynamics. Because of the heterogeneity of the
rational agents' expectations, there is a synchronization problem for the
optimal exit times determined by these arbitrageurs, which leads to the
survival of the bubble almost all the way to its theoretical end time. The

bubbles in financial time series. Avoiding the difficult problem of parameter

surface flows by determining the horizontal scale dependence of the velocity
and intensity fields, as represented by their power spectra, and to offer some
theoretical guidelines to interpret these spectra. We use long time series of
images taken by SOT/Hinode and reconstruct both horizontal (by granule
tracking) and vertical (by Doppler effect) velocity fields in a field of view

associated with vertical motions exhibits a k^{-10/3}-like spectrum, while the
intensity fluctuation spectrum follows a k^{-3} or k^{-17/3}-like spectrum at
the two continuum levels investigated (525 and 450 nm respectively). We discuss
the physical origin of these scalings and argue that they provide a direct
observational signature of buoyancy-driven turbulent dynamics in a strongly
thermally diffusive regime. In the mesogranulation range and up to a scale of
25Mm, we find that the vertical velocity field amplitude decreases like
L^{-3/2} with the horizontal scale L. This behaviour corresponds to a k^2
spectral power law. Still in the mesoscale range, [2.5, 10]Mm, we find that
intensity fluctuations in the blue continuum follow a power law in k^2. We show
that granule tracking cannot sample scales below 2.5Mm. We locate the

shorter volatility shocks. In our shock-by-shock causal-link analysis, we also
find shorter delays between corresponding shocks in more closely related

volatility shocks. From a perspective relevant to public policy, our study
suggests an endogeneous sectorial dynamics during the mid-2003 economic

To detect short-period variables, we used the Fast Fourier\nTransform algorithm (FFT) inasmuch as the data points in TAOS light-curves are\nevenly spaced. Using FFT, we found 41 short-period variables with amplitudes\nsmaller than a few hundredths of a magnitude and periods of about an hour,\nwhich suggest that they are low-amplitude delta Scuti stars (LADS).

exoplanet system orbiting the bright nearby G5V star 61 Virginis. Our 4.6 years
of combined Keck/HIRES and Anglo-Australian Telescope precision RVs indicate
the hitherto unknown presence of at least three planets orbiting this
well-studied star. These planets are all on low-eccentricity orbits with
periods of 4.2, 38.0, and 124.0 days, and projected masses (M sini) of 5.1,

Depending on the effectiveness of tidal dissipation within the inner planet,
the inner two planets may have evolved into an eccentricity fixed-point
configuration in which the apsidal lines of all three planets corotate. This
conjecture can be tested with additional observations. We present a 16-year
time series of photometric observations of 61 Virginis, which comprise 1194

parameter is driven itself by a latent random process. For such copulas, both
penultimate and asymptotic tail dependence are much larger than for ordinary
elliptical copulas with the same unconditional correlation. Furthermore, for
Gaussian and Student t-copulas, tail dependence at sub-asymptotic levels is
generally larger than in the limit, which can have serious consequences for
estimation and evaluation of extreme risk. Finally, although correlation
mixtures of Gaussian copulas inherit the property of asymptotic independence,

presence of additive outliers. It is well-known that the sample autocovariance,
being based on moments, does not have this property. Hence, the use of an
autocovariance estimator which is robust to additive outliers can be very
useful for time-series modeling. In this paper, the asymptotic properties of
the robust scale and autocovariance estimators proposed by Rousseeuw and Croux
(1993) and Genton and Ma (2000) are established for Gaussian processes, with
either short-range or long-range dependence. It is shown in the short-range
dependence setting that this robust estimator is asymptotically normal at the
rate $\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of observations. An explicit
expression of the asymptotic variance is also given and compared to the
asymptotic variance of the classical autocovariance estimator. In the
long-range dependence setting, the limiting distribution displays the same
behavior than that of the classical autocovariance estimator, with a Gaussian
limit and rate $\sqrt{n}$ when the Hurst parameter $H$ is less 3/4 and with a
non-Gaussian limit (belonging to the second Wiener chaos) with rate depending
on the Hurst parameter when $H \in (3/4,1)$. Some Monte-Carlo experiments are
presented to illustrate our claims and the Nile River data is analyzed as an

Hence, the use of an\nautocovariance estimator which is robust to additive outliers can be very\nuseful for time-series modeling. In this paper, the asymptotic properties of\nthe robust scale and autocovariance estimators proposed by Rousseeuw and Croux\n(1993) and Genton and Ma (2000) are established for Gaussian processes, with\neither short-range or long-range dependence. It is shown in the short-range\ndependence setting that this robust estimator is asymptotically normal at the\nrate $\\sqrt{n}$, where $n$ is the number of observations. An explicit\nexpression of the asymptotic variance is also given and compared to the\nasymptotic variance of the classical autocovariance estimator. In the\nlong-range dependence setting, the limiting distribution displays the same\nbehavior than that of the classical autocovariance estimator, with a Gaussian\nlimit and rate $\\sqrt{n}$ when the Hurst parameter $H$ is less 3/4 and with a\nnon-Gaussian limit (belonging to the second Wiener chaos) with rate depending\non the Hurst parameter when $H \\in (3/4,1)$.

costs, energy density, thermal efficiency, plant construction cost, interest
rate, capacity factor, and operations and maintenance cost. The dominant
determinants of costs have been the price of coal and plant construction cost.
The price of coal appears to fluctuate more or less randomly while the
construction cost follows long-term trends, decreasing from 1902 - 1970,
increasing from 1970 - 1990, and leveling off since then. Our analysis
emphasizes the importance of using long time series and comparing electricity

single components like capital. By taking this approach we find that the
history of coal-fired electricity costs suggests there is a fluctuating floor

stars has resulted in improvements of the physics in the stellar structure and
evolution models of massive stars. Further asteroseismic constraints can be
obtained from studying ensembles of stars in a young open cluster, which all
have similar age, distance and chemical composition.
  AIMS: To improve our comprehension of the beta Cep stars, we studied the
young open cluster NGC 884 to discover new B-type pulsators, besides the two
known beta Cep stars, and other variable stars.
  METHODS: An extensive multi-site campaign was set up to gather accurate CCD
photometry time series in four filters (U, B, V, I) of a field of NGC884.
Fifteen different instruments collected almost 77500 CCD images in 1286 hours.
The images were calibrated and reduced to transform the CCD frames into
interpretable differential light curves. Various variability indicators and
frequency analyses were applied to detect variable stars in the field. Absolute
photometry was taken to deduce some general cluster and stellar properties.
  RESULTS: We achieved an accuracy for the brightest stars of 5.7 mmag in V,
6.9 mmag in B, 5.0 mmag in I and 5.3 mmag in U. The noise level in the
amplitude spectra is 50 micromag in the V band. Our campaign confirms the
previously known pulsators, and we report more than one hundred new multi- and
mono-periodic B-, A- and F-type stars. Their interpretation in terms of
classical instability domains is not straightforward, pointing to imperfections
in theoretical instability computations. In addition, we have discovered six

stellar magnetic activity and test the feasibility of doing asteroseismology of
magnetically active stars. We analyze 30 years of photometric time-series data,
3 years of HARPS radial velocity monitoring, and 3 nights of high-cadence HARPS
asteroseismic data. We construct a high-S/N HARPS spectrum that we use to
determine atmospheric parameters and chemical composition. Spectra observed at
different rotation phases are analyzed to search for signs of temperature or
abundance variations. An upper limit on the projected rotational velocity is
derived from very high-resolution CES spectra. We detect oscillations in EK Eri
with a frequency of the maximum power of nu_max = 320+/-32 muHz, and we derive
a peak amplitude per radial mode of ~0.15 m/s, which is a factor of ~3 lower
than expected. We suggest that the magnetic field may act to suppress
low-degree modes. Individual frequencies can not be extracted from the
available data. We derive accurate atmospheric parameters, refining our
previous analysis. We confirm that the main light variation is due to cool
spots, but that other contributions may need to be taken into account. We

and we need to take them into account. In particular, if the gaps are not
randomly distributed, they will produce a peak and a series of harmonics in the
periodogram that will destroy the stellar information. An interpolation of the
data can be good solution for this problem. In this paper we have studied an
interpolation method based on the so-called 'inpainting' algorithms. To check
the algorithm, we used both VIRGO and CoRoT satellite data to which we applied
a realistic artificial window of a real CoRoT observing run to introduce gaps.
Next we compared the results with the original, non-windowed data. Therefore,
we were able to optimize the algorithm by minimizing the difference between the
power spectrum density of the data with gaps and the complete time series. In
general, we find that the power spectrum of the inpainted time series is very
similar to the original, unperturbed one. Seismic inferences obtained after
interpolating the data are the same as in the original case.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""In Helio- and asteroseismology, it is important to have continuous,\nuninterrupted, data sets.

An interpolation of the\ndata can be good solution for this problem. In this paper we have studied an\ninterpolation method based on the so-called 'inpainting' algorithms. To check\nthe algorithm, we used both VIRGO and CoRoT satellite data to which we applied\na realistic artificial window of a real CoRoT observing run to introduce gaps.\nNext we compared the results with the original, non-windowed data. Therefore,\nwe were able to optimize the algorithm by minimizing the difference between the\npower spectrum density of the data with gaps and the complete time series. In\ngeneral, we find that the power spectrum of the inpainted time series is very\nsimilar to the original, unperturbed one. Seismic inferences obtained after\ninterpolating the data are the same as in the original case.""}","[{'name': 'K. H. Sato'}, {'name': 'R. A. Garcia'}, {'name': 'S. Pires'}, {'name': 'J.

now potentially allow us to explore the stellar interior of these accretors
using stellar seismology. In this context, we conducted a multi-site campaign
on the accreting pulsator SDSS J161033.64-010223.3 (V386 Ser) using seven
observatories located around the world in May 2007 over a duration of 11 days.
We report the best fit periodicities here, which were also previously observed
in 2004, suggesting their underlying stability. Although we did not uncover a
sufficient number of independent pulsation modes for a unique seismological
fit, our campaign revealed that the dominant pulsation mode at 609s is an
evenly spaced triplet. The even nature of the triplet is suggestive of
rotational splitting, implying an enigmatic rotation period of about 4.8 days.
There are two viable alternatives assuming the triplet is real: either the
period of 4.8 days is representative of the rotation period of the entire star
with implications for the angular momentum evolution of these systems, or it is
perhaps an indication of differential rotation with a fast rotating exterior
and slow rotation deeper in the star. Investigating the possibility that a
changing period could mimic a triplet suggests that this scenario is
improbable, but not impossible.
  Using time-series spectra acquired in May 2009, we determine the orbital
period of SDSS J161033.64-010223.3 to be 83.8 +/- 2.9 min. Three of the
observed photometric frequencies from our May 2007 campaign appear to be linear
combinations of the 609s pulsation mode with the first harmonic of the orbital

properties of stars at different stages of evolution. We have focussed our

range 8-70 Myr: TW Hydrae (~8 Myr), beta Pictoris (~10 Myr), Tucana/Horologium,
Columba, Carina (~30 Myr), and AB Doradus (~70 Myr). Additional data on alpha
Persei and the Pleiades from the literature is also considered. Rotational
periods of stars showing rotational modulation due to photospheric magnetic
activity (i.e. starspots) have been determined applying the Lomb-Scargle
periodogram technique to photometric time-series obtained by the All Sky
Automated Survey (ASAS). The magnetic activity level has been derived from the
amplitude of the V lightcurves. We detected the rotational modulation and
measured the rotation periods of 93 stars for the first time, and confirmed the
periods of 41 stars already known from the literature. For further 10 stars we
revised the period determinations by other authors. The sample was augmented
with periods of 21 additional stars retrieved from the literature. In this way,
for the first time we were able to determine largest set of rotation periods at
ages of ~8, ~10 and ~30 Myr, as well as increase by 150\% the number of known
periodic members of AB Dor.The analysis of the rotation periods in young
stellar associations, supplemented by Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and NGC2264

masses range the most significant variations of the rotation period
distribution are the spin-up between 9 and 30 Myr and the spin-down between 70

measurements, either for direct detection or for confirmation of the planetary
origin of photometric transit signals. This has limited our exploration of the
parameter space of exoplanet hosts to solar- and later-type, sharp-lined stars.
Here we extend the realm of stars with known planetary companions to include
hot, fast-rotating stars. Planet-like transits have previously been reported in
the lightcurve obtained by the SuperWASP survey of the A5 star HD15082
(WASP-33; V=8.3, v sin i = 86 km/sec). Here we report further photometry and
time-series spectroscopy through three separate transits, which we use to
confirm the existence of a gas giant planet with an orbital period of 1.22d in
orbit around HD15082. From the photometry and the properties of the planet
signal travelling through the spectral line profiles during the transit we
directly derive the size of the planet, the inclination and obliquity of its
orbital plane, and its retrograde orbital motion relative to the spin of the
star. This kind of analysis opens the way to studying the formation of planets
around a whole new class of young, early-type stars, hence under different
physical conditions and generally in an earlier stage of formation than in
sharp-lined late-type stars. The reflex orbital motion of the star caused by
the transiting planet is small, yielding an upper mass limit of 4.1 Jupiter
masses on the planet. We also find evidence of a third body of sub-stellar mass
in the system, which may explain the unusual orbit of the transiting planet. In
HD 15082, the stellar line profiles also show evidence of non-radial
pulsations, clearly distinct from the planetary transit signal. This raises the
intriguing possibility that tides raised by the close-in planet may excite or
amplify the pulsations in such stars.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Most of our knowledge of extrasolar planets rests on precise radial-velocity\nmeasurements, either for direct detection or for confirmation of the planetary\norigin of photometric transit signals.

longline fisheries is catch per unit effort (CPUE), here defined as the number
of fish of the targeted species caught per hook and minute of soak time.
Longline CPUE can be affected by interspecific competition and the retrieval of
unbaited or empty hooks, and interannual variation in these can lead to biases
in the apparent abundance trends in the CPUE. Interspecific competition on
longlines has been previously studied but the return of empty hooks is ignored
in all current treatments of longline CPUE. In this work we propose some
different methods to build indices to address the interspecific competition

empty hooks, the relative abundance estimates have constant biases with respect

simple CPUE index behaves poorly in every scenario. Understanding the reasons
for empty hooks allows selection of the appropriate index. A scientific

flux at the poles which is, in turn, correlated with the strength of the next

possible relationship of the tilt angles with other solar cycle parameters, in
order to glean information on the solar dynamo and to estimate their potential

and Kodaikanal observatories covering solar cycles 15 to 21. We analyse the
latitudinal distribution of the tilt angles (Joy's law), their variation from
cycle to cycle and their relationship to other solar cycle parameters, such as
the strength, amplitude and length. The two main results are: 1. An
anti-correlation between the mean normalized tilt angle of a given cycle and
the strength (or amplitude) of that cycle, with a correlation coefficient of
r=-0.95 and r=-0.93 for Mount Wilson and Kodaikanal data, respectively. 2. The
product of the cycle averaged tilt angle and the strength of the same cycle
displays a significant correlation with the strength of the next cycle (r=0.65

dependence in the extremes of a stationary time series and has important
applications in a number of areas, such as hydrology, telecommunications,

It is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal for a large class of

its tuning parameter is developed and different types of confidence intervals
that prove useful in practice proposed. The performance of the estimator is
examined through simulations, which show its highly competitive behavior.
Finally, the estimator is applied to three real data sets of daily crude oil

In all\ncases the algorithm identifies the presence of a motif population in a fast and\nefficient manner due to the utilisation of an intuitive symbolic\nrepresentation.

accurate fit, established by a ${\chi}_{\nu}^2$ analysis, to a combined

system establish the synthetic spectrum comparison on an absolute flux basis

$\dot{M}$ for final models. Based on comparisons for a range of $\dot{M}$

the exponent 0.25 in the expression for the radial temperature profile, a value

However the
transition between normothermia and hypothermia during haemorrhagic shock has
rarely been systematically quantified from intensive time series data. We
estimated the critical transition point (CTP) and provided confidence intervals
for core body temperature response to acute severe haemorrhage in a conscious
rat model. Estimates were obtained by traditional piecewise linear regression
(broken stick model) and compared to those from the more novel bent cable
regression. Bent cable regression relaxes the assumption of an abrupt point
transition, and thus allows the capture of a potentially gradual transition
phase; the broken stick is a special case of the bent cable model. We
calculated two types of confidence intervals, assuming either independent or
autoregressive structure for the residuals. In spite of the severity of the
haemorrhage, median temperature change was minor (0.8 C; IQR 0.57-1.31 C) and
only four of 38 rats were clinically hypothermic (core temperature < 35 C).
However, a transition could be estimated for 23 rats. Bent cable fits were
superior when the transition appeared to be gradual rather than abrupt. In all
cases, assuming independence gave incorrect uncertainty estimates of CTP. For
15 animals, neither model could be fitted because of irregular temperature
profiles that did not conform to the assumption of a single transition.
Arbitrary imposition of broken stick fits on a gradual transition profile and
assuming independent rather than autocorrelated error may result in misleading

Analysis (TSPA) method. Our improvements are the use of a sliding window in
choosing the modelled datasets, a criterion applied to select the best model
for each dataset and the computation of the time scale of change of the light
curve. We test the performance of CPS with simulated and real data. The CPS has
a much improved time resolution which allows us to better investigate fast
evolution of stellar light curves. We can also separate between the cases when
the data is best described by periodic and aperiodic (e.g. constant brightness)
models. We find, however, that the performance of the CPS has certain
limitations. It does not determine the correct model complexity in all cases,
especially when the underlying light curve is constant and the number of
observations too small. Also the sensitivity in detecting two close light curve
minima is limited and it has a certain amount of intrinsic instability in its
period estimation. Using the CPS, we find persistent active longitudes in the

period variations in the stellar light curve, we determine the differential

CFHT and TBL, we report the detection of Zeeman signatures on the prototypical
classical TTauri star AATau, both in photospheric lines and accretion-powered
emission lines. Using time series of unpolarized and circularly polarized
spectra, we reconstruct at two epochs maps of the magnetic field, surface
brightness and accretion-powered emission of AATau. We find that AATau hosts a
2-3kG magnetic dipole tilted at ~20deg to the rotation axis, and of presumably
dynamo origin. We also show that the magnetic poles of AATau host large cool
spots at photospheric level and accretion regions at chromospheric level.
  The logarithmic accretion rate at the surface of AATau at the time of our
observations is strongly variable, ranging from -9.6 to -8.5 and equal to -9.2
in average (in Msun/yr); this is an order of magnitude smaller than the disc
accretion rate at which the magnetic truncation radius (below which the disc is
disrupted by the stellar magnetic field) matches the corotation radius (where
the Keplerian period equals the stellar rotation period) - a necessary
condition for accretion to occur. It suggests that AATau is largely in the
propeller regime, with most of the accreting material in the inner disc regions
being expelled outwards and only a small fraction accreted towards the surface
of the star. The strong variability in the observed surface mass-accretion rate
and the systematic time-lag of optical occultations (by the warped accretion
disc) with respect to magnetic and accretion-powered emission maxima also
support this conclusion.
  Our results imply that AATau is being actively spun-down by the star-disc
magnetic coupling and appears as an ideal laboratory for studying angular
momentum losses of forming Suns in the propeller regime.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'From observations collected with the ESPaDOnS & NARVAL spectropolarimeters at\nCFHT and TBL, we report the detection of Zeeman signatures on the prototypical\nclassical TTauri star AATau, both in photospheric lines and accretion-powered\nemission lines.

that Kepler has observed (seven so far) is a long-period pulsator of the
V1093~Her (PG~1716) class or a hybrid star with both short and long periods.
The apparently non-binary long-period and hybrid pulsators are described here.
  The V1093~Her periods range from one to 4.5~h and are associated with
$g-$mode pulsations. Three stars also exhibit short periods indicative of
$p-$modes with periods of 2 to 5~m and in addition, these stars exhibit
periodicities between both classes from 15 to 45~m. We detect the coolest and

obtained at 3.6 microns with the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the

strong systematics and conclusions could hardly be obtained with confidence on
the water detection by comparison of the 3.6 and 5.8 microns observations. We
use a high S/N Spitzer photometric transit light curve to improve the precision
of the near infrared radius of the planet at 3.6 microns. The observation has
been performed using high-cadence time series integrated in the subarray mode.
We are able to derive accurate system parameters, including planet-to-star
radius ratio, impact parameter, scale of the system, and central time of the
transit from the fits of the transit light curve. We compare the results with
transmission spectroscopic models and with results from previous observations
at the same wavelength. We obtained the following system parameters:
R_p/R_\star=0.15566+0.00011-0.00024, b=0.661+0.0053-0.0050, and
a/R_\star=8.925+0.0490-0.0523 at 3.6 microns. These measurements are three
times more accurate than previous studies at this wavelength because they
benefit from greater observational efficiency and less statistic and systematic
errors. Nonetheless, we find that the radius ratio has to be corrected for
stellar activity and present a method to do so using ground-based long-duration
photometric follow-up in the V-band. The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio
corrected for the stellar variability is in agreement with the previous

that water vapour could not be evidenced by comparison of the planetary radius

The resulting planet-to-star radius ratio\ncorrected for the stellar variability is in agreement with the previous\nmeasurement obtained in the same bandpass (Desert et al. 2009). We also discuss\nthat water vapour could not be evidenced by comparison of the planetary radius\nmeasured at 3.6 and 5.8 microns, because the radius measured at 3.6 microns is\naffected by absorption by other species, possibly Rayleigh scattering by haze.'}","[{'name': 'J. -M.

quasar detection fractions (99% completeness with default cuts), given an
acceptable rate of false alarms. We establish the typical rate of false alarms
due to known variable stars as <3% (high purity). Applying the classification,
we increase the sample of potential quasars relative to those known in Stripe
82 by as much as 29%, and by nearly a factor of two in the redshift range

(from 1865 to 2005). The two stations with the longest time series of
temperature measurements (Lisbon and Coimbra) have been used to study the
dependence of the portuguese climate variations on the changes of both global
circulation and solar activity. Monthly averaged temperature series have been
analyzed together with monthly North-Atlantic Oscillation index data, sunspot
numbers and cosmic ray flux intensity. Different statistical methods (the
correlation analysis and the multiple regression analysis) were used. Our
results show that the temperature in Portugal depends not only on the
atmospheric variations in the studied region but also on the variations of the
solar parameters such as sunspot numbers and the cosmic rays flux intensity.
Also, the dependence of temperature on solar parameters is strong during the
cold season (November to February), while much weaker during the warm season.
For some months, strong correlations between the temperature variations of the
current month and the North-Atlantic Oscillation index values of the previous
month have been found. The correlation between climatic and solar parameters
shows up best on the decadal and decadal-to-centennial timescale. It is found
that the temperature correlates positively with the sunspot numbers and
negatively with the CR flux intensity throughout the year. Besides, the
absolute values of the correlation coefficients between the temperature and the
CR are higher than those between the temperature and the sunspot numbers. Our
results are consistent with some of the proposed mechanisms that relate solar
activity to Earth climate and could be explained through the effect of the
solar UV radiation and stratosphere-troposphere coupling or/and through the
effect of the CR particles on clouds and stratospheric and tropospheric
conditions.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We present the analysis of temperature variations in Portugal for 140 years\n(from 1865 to 2005).

describes in general terms how graphical modeling may be used to learn from
biophysical time series data using the variational Bayesian expectation
maximization algorithm (VBEM). The discussion is illustrated by the example of
single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer (smFRET) versus time
data, where the smFRET time series is modeled as a hidden Markov model (HMM)
with Gaussian observables. A detailed description of smFRET is provided as
well. Results: The VBEM algorithm returns the model's evidence and an
approximating posterior parameter distribution given the data. The former
provides a metric for model selection via maximum evidence (ME), and the latter
a description of the model's parameters learned from the data. ME/VBEM provide
several advantages over the more commonly used approach of maximum likelihood
(ML) optimized by the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, the most
important being a natural form of model selection and a well-posed
(non-divergent) optimization problem. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the
utility of graphical modeling for inference of dynamic processes in single

chromospheric activity as a function of color and height above the main

Thus, our aim is to show how to use multiple weighted and standard\nsingular value decompositions to detect, extract and clarify the $\\mathrm\n{Ca}^{2+}$ signals.

V20 in the open cluster NGC 6791 were accurate enough to demonstrate that there
are significant differences between current stellar models. Here we improve on
those results and add measurements of two additional detached eclipsing
binaries, the cluster members V18 and V80. The enlarged sample sets much
tighter constraints on the properties of stellar models than has hitherto been
possible, thereby improving both the accuracy and precision of the cluster age.
We employed (i) high-resolution UVES spectroscopy of V18, V20 and V80 to
determine their spectroscopic effective temperatures, [Fe/H] values, and
spectroscopic orbital elements, and (ii) time-series photometry from the Nordic
Optical Telescope to obtain the photometric elements. The masses and radii of
the V18 and V20 components are found to high accuracy, with errors on the
masses in the range 0.27-0.36% and errors on the radii in the range 0.61-0.92%.
V80 is found to be magnetically active, and more observations are needed to
determine its parameters accurately. The metallicity of NGC 6791 is measured
from disentangled spectra of the binaries and a few single stars to be [Fe/H]=
+0.29 \pm 0.03 (random) \pm 0.07 (systematic). The cluster reddening and
apparent distance modulus are found to be E(B - V) = 0.160 \pm 0.025 and (m -

three exoplanet systems; HD 189733, GJ-436 and XO-1. Detections of several
molecules, including H20, CH4 and CO2, have been claimed for HD 189733 and
XO-1, but similarly sized features are attributed to systematic noise for
GJ-436. The data consist of time-series grism spectra covering a planetary
transit. After extracting light curves in independent wavelength channels, we
use a linear decorrelation technique account for instrumental systematics
(which is becoming standard in the field), and measure the planet-to-star
radius ratio as a function of wavelength. For HD 189733, the uncertainties in
the transmission spectrum are significantly larger than those previously
reported. We also find the transmission spectrum is considerably altered when
using different out-of-transit orbits to remove the systematics, when some
parameters are left out of the decorrelation procedure, or when we perform the
decorrelation with quadratic functions rather than linear functions. Given that
there is no physical reason to believe the baseline flux should be modelled as
a linear function of any particular set of parameters, we interpret this as
evidence that the linear decorrelation technique is not a robust method to
remove systematic effects from the light curves for each wavelength channel.
For XO-1, the parameters measured to decorrelate the light curves would require
extrapolation to the in-transit orbit to remove the systematics, and we cannot
reproduce the previously reported results. We conclude that the resulting
NICMOS transmission spectra are too dependent on the method used to remove
systematics to be considered robust detections of molecular species in

Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) global, three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations of the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction. These simulations are
driven with synthetic solar wind input conditions, where idealized ULF dynamic
pressure fluctuations are embedded in the upstream solar wind. In three of the
simulations, a monochromatic, sinusoidal ULF oscillation is introduced into the
solar wind dynamic pressure time series. In the fourth simulation, a continuum
of ULF fluctuations over the 0-50 mHz frequency band is introduced into the
solar wind dynamic pressure time series. In this numerical experiment, the
idealized solar wind input conditions allow us to study only the effect of a
fluctuating solar wind dynamic pressure, while holding all of the other solar
wind driving parameters constant. We show that the monochromatic solar wind
dynamic pressure fluctuations drive toroidal mode field line resonances (FLRs)
on the dayside, at locations where the upstream driving frequency matches a
local field line eigenfrequency. In addition, we show that the continuum of
upstream solar wind dynamic pressure fluctuations drives a continuous spectrum
of toroidal mode FLRs on the dayside. The characteristics of the simulated FLRs
agree well with FLR observations, including a phase reversal radially across a
peak in wave power, a change in the sense of polarization across the noon
meridian, and a net flux of energy into the ionosphere.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Several observational studies suggest that solar wind dynamic pressure\nfluctuations can drive magnetospheric ultra-low frequency (ULF) waves on the\ndayside.

massive and cooler component filling its Roche lobe. The more massive component
is an SX Phe variable. The orbital period of V60 increases at a rate of
dP/P=3.0E-9. In addition to numerous variable blue stragglers we also report
the detection of two red stragglers showing periodic variability. Both of these

The mean outburst interval is 197 \pm 59 d, with a median of 193 d. The March
2008 superoutburst was preceeded by a precursor outburst, had an amplitude of
4.2 magnitudes, and the whole event lasted about 16 days. No superhumps were

birdsongs have not yet been fully addressed. In this study, we investigate the
statistical propertiesof the complex birdsong of the Bengalese finch (Lonchura

show that there are significant higher-order context dependencies in Bengalese
finch songs, that is, which syllable appears next depends on more than one
previous syllable. This property is shared with other complex sequential
behaviors. We then analyze acoustic features of the song and show that
higher-order context dependencies can be explained using first-order hidden
state transition dynamics with redundant hidden states. This model corresponds
to hidden Markov models (HMMs), well known statistical models with a large
range of application for time series modeling. The song annotation with these
models with first-order hidden state dynamics agreed well with manual
annotation, the score was comparable to that of a second-order HMM, and
surpassed the zeroth-order model (the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)), which does

We report on a detailed study of the optical afterglow of GRB 061121
with our original time-series photometric data. In conjunction with X-ray
observations, we discuss the origin of its optical and X-ray afterglows.
Methods. We observed the optical afterglow of Swift burst GRB 061121 with the
Kanata 1.5-m telescope at Higashi-Hiroshima Observatory. Our observation covers
a period just after an X-ray plateau phase. We also performed deep imaging with
the Subaru telescope in 2010 in order to estimate the contamination of the host
galaxy. Results. In the light curve, we find that the optical afterglow also
exhibited a break as in the X-ray afterglow. However, our observation suggests
a possible hump structure or a flattening period before the optical break in
the light curve. There is no sign of such a hump in the X-ray light curve.
Conclusions. This implies that the emitting region of optical was distinct from
that of X-rays. The hump in the optical light curve was possibly caused by the
passage of the typical frequency of synchrotron emission from another forward
shock distinct from the early afterglow. The observed decay and spectral
indices are inconsistent with the standard synchrotron-shock model. Hence, the
observation requires a change in microphysical parameters in the shock region
or a prior activity of the central engine. Alternatively, the emission during
the shallow decay phase may be a composition of two forward shock emissions, as
indicated by the hump structure in the light curve.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Aims.

system. HD 46375 is a solar analog known to host a non-transiting Saturn-mass
exoplanet with a 3.0236 day period. It was observed by the CoRoT satellite for
34 days during the fall of 2008. We attempt to identify at optical wavelengths,
the changing phases of the planet as it orbits its star. We then try to improve
the star model by means of a seismic analysis of the same light curve and the
use of ground-based spectropolarimetric observations. The data analysis relies
on the Fourier spectrum and the folding of the time series. We find evidence of
a sinusoidal signal compatible in terms of both amplitude and phase with light
reflected by the planet. Its relative amplitude is Delta Fp/F* = [13.0, 26.8]

temperature Tb ~ [1880,2030] K by assuming a radius R=1.1 R_Jup and an
inclination i=45 deg. Its orbital phase differs from that of the
radial-velocity signal by at most 2 sigma_RV. However, the tiny planetary
signal is strongly blended by another signal, which we attribute to a telluric
signal with a 1 day period. We show that this signal is suppressed, but not
eliminated, when using the time series for HD 46179 from the same CoRoT run as
a reference. This detection of reflected light from a non-transiting planet

ultra-precise photometric lightcurves with present-day observations by CoRoT

selected sample of DA white dwarfs near the blue edge of the DAV (g-mode)
instability strip, where the p-modes should be excited following theoretical
models. A set of high quality time-series data on nine targets has been
obtained in 3 photometric bands (Sloan u', g', r') using ULTRACAM at the VLT
with a typical time resolution of a few tens of ms. Such high resolution is
required because theory predicts very short periods, of the order of a second,
for the p-modes in white dwarfs. The data have been analyzed using Fourier
transform and correlation analysis methods. Results: P-modes have not been
detected in any of our targets. The upper limits obtained for the pulsation
amplitude, typically less than 0.1%, are the smallest limits reported in the
literature. The Nyquist frequencies are large enough to fully cover the
frequency range of interest for the p-modes. For the brightest target of our
sample, G 185-32, a p-mode oscillation with a relative amplitude of 5x10**(-4)
would have been easily detected, as shown by a simple simulation. For G 185-32
we note an excess of power below ~2 Hz in all the three nights of observation,
which might be due in principle to tens of low-amplitude close modes. However,
neither correlation analysis nor Fourier transform of the amplitude spectrum
show significant results. We also checked the possibility that the p-modes have
a very short lifetime, shorter than the observing runs, by dividing each run in
several subsets and analyzing these subsets independently. The amplitude

magnetospheric accretion processes of the classical TTauri star (cTTS)
V2129Oph. In this paper, we present spectropolarimetric observations collected
in 2009 July with ESPaDOnS at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT).
Circularly polarised Zeeman signatures are clearly detected, both in
photospheric absorption and accretion-powered emission lines, from time-series
of which we reconstruct new maps of the magnetic field, photospheric brightness
and accretion-powered emission at the surface of V2129Oph using our newest
tomographic imaging tool - to be compared with those derived from our old 2005
June data set, reanalyzed in the exact same way.
  We find that in 2009 July, V2129Oph hosts octupolar & dipolar field
components of about 2.1 & 0.9kG respectively, both tilted by about 20deg with
respect to the rotation axis; we conclude that the large-scale magnetic
topology changed significantly since 2005 June (when the octupole and dipole
components were about 1.5 and 3 times weaker respectively), demonstrating that
the field of V2129Oph is generated by a non-stationary dynamo. We also show
that V2129Oph features a dark photospheric spot and a localised area of
accretion-powered emission, both close to the main surface magnetic region
(hosting fields of up to about 4kG in 2009 July). We finally obtain that the
surface shear of V2129Oph is about half as strong as solar.
  From the fluxes of accretion-powered emission lines, we estimate that the
observed average logarithmic accretion rate (in Msun/yr) at the surface of
V2129Oph is -9.2+-0.3 at both epochs, peaking at -9.0 at magnetic maximum. It
implies in particular that the radius at which the magnetic field of V2129Oph
truncates the inner accretion disc is 0.93x and 0.50x the corotation radius in
2009 July and 2005 June respectively.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We report here the first results of a multi-wavelength campaign focussing on\nmagnetospheric accretion processes of the classical TTauri star (cTTS)\nV2129Oph.

medicine, where diseases will be prevented by preemptive cures.
Quantum-mechanical tunneling through single-stranded DNA in a solid-state

tunneling current alone cannot distinguish the four nucleotides due to large
fluctuations in molecular conformation and solvent. Here, we propose a
machine-learning approach applied to the tunneling current-voltage (I-V)
characteristic for efficient discrimination between the four nucleotides. We
first combine principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy c-means (FCM)
clustering to learn the ""fingerprints"" of the electronic density-of-states
(DOS) of the four nucleotides, which can be derived from the I-V data. We then
apply the hidden Markov model and the Viterbi algorithm to sequence a time
series of DOS data (i.e., to solve the sequencing problem). Numerical
experiments show that the PCA-FCM approach can classify unlabeled DOS data with
91% accuracy. Furthermore, the classification is found to be robust against
moderate levels of noise, i.e., 70% accuracy is retained with a signal-to-noise
ratio of 26 dB. The PCA-FCM-Viterbi approach provides a 4-fold increase in
accuracy for the sequencing problem compared with PCA alone. In conjunction

temperature and, to a smaller extent, plasma velocity. The correction ranges
from 2% to 25% in sunspots, and is, on average, less than 2% for other

larger variations obtained for sunspots, and smaller variations obtained for

prediction problem that have a bearing on dynamo theory. The scope of the
review is further restricted to the issue of predicting the amplitude (and
optionally the epoch) of an upcoming solar maximum no later than right after
the start of the given cycle. Prediction methods form three main groups.
Precursor methods rely on the value of some measure of solar activity or
magnetism at a specified time to predict the amplitude of the following solar
maximum. Their implicit assumption is that each numbered solar cycle is a
consistent unit in itself, while solar activity seems to consist of a series of
much less tightly intercorrelated individual cycles. Extrapolation methods, in
contrast, are based on the premise that the physical process giving rise to the
sunspot number record is statistically homogeneous, i.e., the mathematical
regularities underlying its variations are the same at any point of time, and
therefore it lends itself to analysis and forecasting by time series methods.
Finally, instead of an analysis of observational data alone, model based
predictions use physically (more or less) consistent dynamo models in their
attempts to predict solar activity. In their overall performance precursor
methods have clearly been superior to extrapolation methods. Nevertheless, some
extrapolation methods may still be worth further study. Model based forecasts

Among\nother properties, this kernel can be easily computed when the dimension d of\nthe time series is much larger than the lengths of the considered time series x\nand x'. It can also be generalized to time series taking values in arbitrary\nstate spaces, as long as the state space itself is endowed with a kernel\n\\kappa. In that case, the kernel between x and x' is a a function of the Gram\nmatrices produced by \\kappa on observations and subsequences of observations\nenumerated in x and x'.

asymptotics, in extensive finite sample simulation studies, and in a data

interacting gravitationally and in the process (1) propose and implement a
nearly energy-conserving numerical integration scheme for evolving the
concentric spherical shells systems with 1024 particles or less; (2) look at
the possibility of chaos in few shell systems; and (3) study the evolution of
many shell systems in the Vlasov limit.
  The proposed numerical integration scheme is a nearly energy conserving
hybrid of the Verlet and modified Euler-Cromer integration schemes.
  The rotational 2-shell spherical system is investigated in detail using the
hybrid numerical integration scheme. Plots of time-series, phase space
projections, Poincare sections, power spectra, and Lyapunov exponents are
obtained for the system. These diagnostic tools, taken together, clearly show
the chaotic nature of the rotational 2-shell system. Three types of periodic
orbits are observed: collapsed, one-point, and three-point periodic orbits. We
believe that the three-point periodic orbits result from a rotation-induced
bifurcation. Four types of quasiperiodic orbits are also observed. Three of
these are a result of slight changes in the initial conditions corresponding to
the three types of periodic orbits. The fourth type of quasiperiodic orbit
separates the chaotic region from the non-chaotic regions in phase space.

using both numerical and analytical methods. Approximate expressions for the

reconstruct the surface intensity patterns of non-radial stellar oscillations

accepts the light curve and the detected pulsation frequencies on input, and on
output yields estimates of the pulsation patterns, in form of images -- thus
allowing a direct identification of the surface mode numbers$(\ell,m)$.
  Since it has minimal modelling requirements and can operate on photometric
observations in arbitrary wavelength bands, DEM is well suited to analyze the
wide-band time series collected by space observatories.
  The method was extensively tested on simulated data, in which almost all
photometrically detectable modes with a latitudinal complexity $\ell-|m|\le 4$

natural manner, as well as pulsations on components with tilted rotation axis

mapping, nor any other inversion technique can ever surpass.

Preliminary computational experiments are presented\nand confirm the very good performances of the proposed approach.'}","[{'name': 'Stéphane Chrétien'}, {'name': 'Juan-Pablo Ortega'}]",{'name': 'Juan-Pablo Ortega'},Juan-Pablo Ortega,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.5475v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.5475v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","35 pages, 5 figures",,"{'term': 'q-fin.CP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'q-fin.CP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'q-fin.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': '91G70, 65C60', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",

been developed and applied to study a wide range of model systems as well as
real-world data, e.g., geophysical or financial time series. Among these
techniques, recurrence-based concepts and prominently $\epsilon$-recurrence
networks, most faithfully represent the geometrical fine structure of the
attractors underlying chaotic (and less interestingly non-chaotic) time series.
In this paper we demonstrate that the well known graph theoretical properties
local clustering coefficient and global (network) transitivity can meaningfully
be exploited to define two new local and two new global measures of dimension
in phase space: local upper and lower clustering dimension as well as global
upper and lower transitivity dimension. Rigorous analytical as well as
numerical results for self-similar sets and simple chaotic model systems
suggest that these measures are well-behaved in most non-pathological
situations and that they can be estimated reasonably well using
$\epsilon$-recurrence networks constructed from relatively short time series.
Moreover, we study the relationship between clustering and transitivity
dimensions on the one hand, and traditional measures like pointwise dimension
or local Lyapunov dimension on the other hand. We also provide further evidence
that the local clustering coefficients, or equivalently the local clustering
dimensions, are useful for identifying unstable periodic orbits and other

component analysis, which minimizes the variance of the residuals after
removing the global trend. Using random matrix theory, a significant fraction

in their power density spectra below which the power density spectra are nearly
in white noise structure and at higher frequencies they approximately follow

  To determine whether high mass X-ray binary power density spectra have
similar properties and the findings for low mass X-ray binaries are also valid
for high mass binaries, we analyzed the time series of high mass X-ray binary

  Method: We obtained the power density spectra of the high mass X-ray binaries
using the cosine transform of autocorrelation function.
  Results: We identified break frequencies for seven sources, namely OAO

longitude system of the young solar analogue HD 116956 in detail, especially
concentrating on determining the rotation period of the spot-generating
mechanism with respect to the photometric rotation period of the star itself.
Because the nonparametric approach, like the Kuiper method, can only give the
period of active longitudes, we formulate a new method that can determine the
parameters the active longitude distribution uniquely.
  Methods: For this purpose, we have developed an analysis method, based on
Bayesian statistics using Markov chain Monte Carlo, presented in this
manuscript. One of the advantages of this method is that an estimate of the
active longitude system rotation period, as well as the parameters of the shape
and location of the active longitudes together with their respective error
estimates. This allows us to compare the active longitude and mean photospheric
rotation periods of the star.
  Results: Our analysis confirms previous results of the object having two
stable active longitudes with a phase difference of Delta phi = 0.5, the other
longitude having dominated over the other one during almost the entire span of
the time series. Our method gives the rotation period of the active longitude
system P_al = 7.8412 +- 0.00002 d, which is significantly different from the
mean photospheric rotation period of the star P_rot = 7.817 +- 0.003 d.
  Conclusions: Our analysis indicates that the spot-generating mechanism,
manifesting itself as a system of two active longitudes, is lagging behind the
overall rotation of the star. This behaviour may be interpreted as a
nonaxisymmetric dynamo wave propagating in the rotational reference frame of
the stellar surface.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Aims: In this study, we aim at investigating the properties of the active\nlongitude system of the young solar analogue HD 116956 in detail, especially\nconcentrating on determining the rotation period of the spot-generating\nmechanism with respect to the photometric rotation period of the star itself.\nBecause the nonparametric approach, like the Kuiper method, can only give the\nperiod of active longitudes, we formulate a new method that can determine the\nparameters the active longitude distribution uniquely.\n  Methods: For this purpose, we have developed an analysis method, based on\nBayesian statistics using Markov chain Monte Carlo, presented in this\nmanuscript.

analysis on the nearly continuous month-long Kepler datasets of these 5
objects; these datasets provide nearly alias-free time-series photometry at
unprecedented precision. Following an iterative prewhitening process we derive
the pulsational frequency spectra of these stars, separating out artefacts of
known instrumental origin. We find that these new pulsating sdB stars are
multiperiodic long-period pulsators of the V1093 Her type, with the number of
periodicities ranging from 8 (KIC8302197) to 53 (KIC11558725). The frequencies
and amplitudes are typical of g-mode pulsators of this type. We do not find any
evidence for binarity in the five stars from their observed pulsation
frequencies. As these are g-mode pulsators, we briefly looked for period
spacings for mode identification, and found average spacings about 260s and
145s. This may indicate l=1 and 2 patterns. Some modes may show evidence of
rotational splitting. These discoveries complete the list of compact pulsators

important mechanism, which drives solar activity in all its facets. For

the redistribution of flux during the decay of sunspots, and the built-up of
magnetic shear in flaring active regions. Aims: Systematic studies based on
G-band data from the Japanese Hinode mission provide the means to gather
statistical properties of horizontal flow fields. This facilitates comparative
studies of solar features, e.g., G-band bright points, magnetic knots, pores,

adapted Local Correlation Tracking (LCT) to measure horizontal flow fields
based on G-band images obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope on board
Hinode. In total about 200 time-series with a duration between 1-16 h and a
cadence between 15-90 s were analyzed. Selecting both a high-cadence (dt = 15
s) and a long-duration (dT = 16 h) time-series enabled us to optimize and
validate the LCT input parameters, hence, ensuring a robust, reliable, uniform,
and accurate processing of a huge data volume. Results: The LCT algorithm
produces best results for G-band images having a cadence of 60-90 s. If the
cadence is lower, the velocity of slowly moving features will not be reliably
detected. If the cadence is higher, the scene on the Sun will have evolved too
much to bear any resemblance with the earlier situation. Consequently, in both

campaigns. TMT planned to monitor PWV at the sites of interest by means of
using infrared radiometers. Technical failures and calibration issues prevented
them from having a sufficiently long PWV time-series to characterize the sites

sites using radiosonde soundings to validate historical time-series of PWV
reconstructed by way of a spectroscopic analysis of astronomical standard
sources observed at the La Silla and the Paranal sites. The E-ELT also
estimated the median PWV for the Armazones site from extrapolation of their
Paranal statistics accounting for the difference in elevation between the two
places; and also from archival analysis of radiosonde data available from the
city of Antofagasta by integration of the humidity profile starting from 3000 m
altitude. In the case of the Armazones site, the published median of PWV by
both groups differ by about 1 mm with the E-ELT values being drier than those
estimated by the TMT group. This work looks at some of the reasons that could

Time-distance analysis reveals velocities as\nhigh as 64 km/s along the flare ribbon and 15 km/s perpendicular to it. The\nvelocities are very similar in both the H-alpha and Ca II K time series.\nLine-of-sight H-alpha velocities are red-shifted with values up to 17 km/s. The\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution of the observations have allowed us to\ndetect velocities significantly higher than those found in earlier studies.\nFlare bursts with a periodicity of approximately 60 s are also detected. These\nbursts are similar to the quasi-periodic oscillations observed at hard X-ray\nand radio wavelength data. Some of the highest velocities detected in the solar\natmosphere are presented. Line-of-sight velocity maps show considerable mixing\nof both the magnitude and direction of velocities along the flare path. A\nchange in direction of the velocities at the flare kernel has also been\ndetected which may be a signature of chromospheric evaporation.'}","[{'name': 'Peter H. Keys'}, {'name': 'David B.

We present a physically consistent reconstruction of the total solar
irradiance for the Holocene. Methods. We extend the SATIRE models to estimate
the evolution of the total (and partly spectral) solar irradiance over the
Holocene. The basic assumption is that the variations of the solar irradiance
are due to the evolution of the dark and bright magnetic features on the solar
surface. The evolution of the decadally averaged magnetic flux is computed from
decadal values of cosmogenic isotope concentrations recorded in natural
archives employing a series of physics-based models connecting the processes
from the modulation of the cosmic ray flux in the heliosphere to their record
in natural archives. We then compute the total solar irradiance (TSI) as a
linear combination of the jth and jth + 1 decadal values of the open magnetic
flux. Results. Reconstructions of the TSI over the Holocene, each valid for a
di_erent paleomagnetic time series, are presented. Our analysis suggests that
major sources of uncertainty in the TSI in this model are the heritage of the
uncertainty of the TSI since 1610 reconstructed from sunspot data and the
uncertainty of the evolution of the Earth's magnetic dipole moment. The
analysis of the distribution functions of the reconstructed irradiance for the
last 3000 years indicates that the estimates based on the virtual axial dipole
moment are significantly lower at earlier times than the reconstructions based
on the virtual dipole moment. Conclusions. We present the first physics-based
reconstruction of the total solar irradiance over the Holocene, which will be

is formalized, a method for the recovery of such a signal from potentially
noisy observations is proposed, and the time-varying bias properties of the
recovery method are derived. The method, an extension of wavelet ridge analysis
to the multivariate case, identifies the common oscillation by seeking, at each
point in time, a frequency for which a bandpassed version of the signal obtains
a local maximum in power. The lowest-order bias is shown to involve a quantity,
termed the instantaneous curvature, which measures the strength of local
quadratic modulation of the signal after demodulation by the common oscillation
frequency. The bias can be made to be small if the analysis filter, or wavelet,
can be chosen such that the signal's instantaneous curvature changes little

variations on time scales of days--months in blazars, and discuss their
universal aspects. We performed monitoring of 42 blazars in the optical and
near-infrared bands from 2008 to 2010 using TRISPEC attached to the ""Kanata""
1.5-m telescope. We found that 28 blazars exhibited ""bluer-when-brighter""
trends in their whole or a part of time-series data sets. This corresponds to
88% of objects that were observed for >10 days. Thus, our observation
unambiguously confirmed that the ""bluer-when-brighter"" trend is common in the
emission from blazar jets. This trend was apparently generated by a variation
component with a constant and relatively blue color and an underlying red
component. Prominent short-term flares on time scales of days--weeks tended to
exhibit a spectral hysteresis; their rising phases were bluer than their decay
phases around the flare maxima. In contrast to the strong flux--color
correlation, the correlation of the flux and polarization degree was relatively
weak; only 10 objects showed significant positive correlations. Rotations of
polarization were detected only in three objects: PKS 1510-089, 3C 454.3, and
PKS 1749+096, and possibly in S5 0716+714. We also investigated the dependence
of the degree of variability on the luminosity and the synchrotron peak
frequency, \nu_peak. As a result, we found that lower luminosity and higher
\nu_peak objects had smaller variations in their amplitudes both in the flux,
color, and polarization degree. Our observation suggests the presence of
several distinct emitting sources, which have different variation time-scales,
colors, and polarizations. We propose that the energy injection by, for

strong accretion-driven variability at all epochs, that manifests itself as red
noise. This flickering produces transient peaks in the observed power spectrum
in the 15-65 min period range. Only in one of our 12 optical datasets can we
see evidence for a period that cannot be reproduced using the red noise model.
This period of 51 minutes coincides with the strongest period detected by
Shahbaz et al. (2008) and can thus be taken as the prime candidate for the
orbital period of the system. Furthermore, we find some tentative evidence for
the X-ray vs. optical flux anticorrelation discovered by Machin et al. (1990)

drastic changes in the accretion disc geometry/structure on time scales from

velocity impact craters on the Earth with ages up to 2400Myr and diameters up
to 300km. Some studies have identified a periodicity in their age distribution,
with periods ranging from 13 to 50Myr. It has further been claimed that such
periods may be causally linked to a periodic motion of the solar system through
the Galactic plane. However, many of these studies suffer from methodological
problems, for example misinterpretation of p-values, overestimation of
significance in the periodogram or a failure to consider plausible alternative
models. Here I develop a Bayesian method for this problem in which impacts are
treated as a stochastic phenomenon. Models for the time variation of the impact
probability are defined and the evidence for them in the geological record is
compared using Bayes factors. This probabilistic approach obviates the need for
ad hoc statistics, and also makes explicit use of the age uncertainties. I find
strong evidence for a monotonic decrease in the recorded impact rate going back
in time over the past 250Myr for craters larger than 5km. The same is found for
the past 150Myr when craters with upper age limits are included. This is
consistent with a crater preservation/discovery bias modulating an otherwise
constant impact rate. The set of craters larger than 35km (so less affected by
erosion and infilling) and younger than 400Myr are best explained by a constant
impact probability model. A periodic variation in the cratering rate is
strongly disfavoured in all data sets. There is also no evidence for a
periodicity superimposed on a constant rate or trend, although this more
complex signal would be harder to distinguish.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Giant impacts by comets and asteroids have probably had an important\ninfluence on terrestrial biological evolution.

obtained by the CoRoT satellite that show the presence of five independent
oscillation frequencies in the range 3.6-5 c/d. Using spectra acquired with
FLAMES@VLT, we derive the following stellar parameters: spectral type F1V,
T$_{\rm eff}$=7000$\pm$200 K, log(g)=$3.8\pm0.4$, [M/H]=$-1.1\pm0.2$,
$v$sin$i$=$50\pm5$ km/s, L/L$_{\odot}$=21$^{+21}_{-11}$. Thus, for the first
time we report the existence of a metal poor, intermediate-mass PMS pulsating
star. Ground-based and satellite data are used to derive the spectral energy
distribution of CoRoT\,102699796 extending from the optical to mid-infrared
wavelengths. The SED shows a significant IR excess at wavelengths greater than
$\sim5 \mu$. We conclude that CoRoT\,102699796 is a young Herbig Ae (F1Ve) star
with a transitional disk, likely associated to the HII region [FT96]213.1-2.2.
  The pulsation frequencies have been interpreted in the light of the
non-radial pulsation theory, using the LOSC code in conjunction with static and
rotational evolutionary tracks. A minimization algorithm was used to find the
best-fit model with M=1.84 M$_{\odot}$, T$_{\rm eff}$=6900 K which imply an
isochronal age of t$\sim$2.5 Myr. This result is based on the interpretation of
the detected frequencies as $g$-modes of low-moderate $n$-value. To our
knowledge, this is the first time that such modes are identified in a
intermediate-mass PMS pulsating star. Since CoRoT\,102699796 lies in the region
of the HR diagram where the $\delta$ Sct and $\gamma$ Dor instability strips
intersect, we argue that the observed pulsation characteristics are
intermediate between these classes of variables, i.e. CoRoT\,102699796 is

pointed out by many authors. Finding an answer to this difficult question is of
importance to model time-series showing trend-like behavior, such as river
run-off in hydrology, historical temperatures in the study of climates changes,
or packet counts in network traffic engineering. The main goal of this paper is
to develop a test procedure to detect the presence of non-stationarity for a
class of processes whose $K$-th order difference is stationary. Contrary to
most of the proposed methods, the test procedure has the same distribution for
short-range and long-range dependence covariance stationary processes, which
means that this test is able to detect the presence of non-stationarity for
processes showing long-range dependence or which are unit root. The proposed
test is formulated in the wavelet domain, where a change in the generalized
spectral density results in a change in the variance of wavelet coefficients at
one or several scales. Such tests have been already proposed in
\cite{whitcher:2001}, but these authors do not have taken into account the
dependence of the wavelet coefficients within scales and between scales.
Therefore, the asymptotic distribution of the test they have proposed was
erroneous; as a consequence, the level of the test under the null hypothesis of
stationarity was wrong. In this contribution, we introduce two test procedures,

photometric precisions better than 10 mmag for stars brighter than V 18.5mag

precision has resulted in the discovery of two new RR1 stars and thirteen SX
Phe stars. A detailed identification chart is given for all the variable stars

an intricate understanding of one's data and the analysis techniques used.
Correcting the raw data at the 10^-4 level of accuracy in flux is one of the
central challenges. This can be difficult for instruments that do not feature a
calibration plan for such high precision measurements. Here, it is not always
obvious how to de-correlate the data using auxiliary information of the
instrument and it becomes paramount to know how well one can disentangle
instrument systematics from one's data, given nothing but the data itself. We
propose a non-parametric machine learning algorithm, based on the concept of
independent component analysis, to de-convolve the systematic noise and all
non-Gaussian signals from the desired astrophysical signal. Such a `blind'
signal de-mixing is commonly known as the `Cocktail Party problem' in
signal-processing. Given multiple simultaneous observations of the same
exoplanetary eclipse, as in the case of spectrophotometry, we show that we can
often disentangle systematic noise from the original light curve signal without
the use of any complementary information of the instrument. In this paper, we
explore these signal extraction techniques using simulated data and two data
sets observed with the Hubble-NICMOS instrument. Another important application
is the de-correlation of the exoplanetary signal from time-correlated stellar
variability. Using data obtained by the Kepler mission we show that the desired
signal can be de-convolved from the stellar noise using a single time series
spanning several eclipse events. Such non-parametric techniques can provide
important confirmations of the existent parametric corrections reported in the
literature, and their associated results. Additionally they can substantially
improve the precision exoplanetary light curve analysis in the future.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""The characterisation of ever smaller and fainter extrasolar planets requires\nan intricate understanding of one's data and the analysis techniques used.\nCorrecting the raw data at the 10^-4 level of accuracy in flux is one of the\ncentral challenges.

In contrast, our proposed method can still produce an\nestimate as efficient as an \\textit{oracle} under such scenarios.

pronounced photometric variability, which can be used for a more detailed
characterisation of these highly evolved stars. Owing to their well-studied

variations and compare the characteristics of these two LPV populations with
the results found for other galaxies such as the LMC. We carried out
time-series photometry in the i-band of the two target galaxies with the Nordic
Optical Telescope (NOT), covering a time span of \approx2.5 years. These data
were then combined with single-epoch K-band photometry, also obtained with the
NOT. Narrow-band photometry data from the literature was used to distinguish
between O-rich and C-rich stars. We report the detection of 513 LPVs in NGC185

ranging between 90 and 800 days. The period-luminosity diagram for each of our
target galaxies exhibits a well populated sequence of fundamental mode
pulsators. The resulting period-luminosity relations we obtained are compared
to relations from the literature. We discuss the universality of those
relations because of which, as a side result, a correction of the distance
modulus of NGC185 may be necessary. Only one of our two galaxies, namely
NGC185, has a significant fraction of possibly first overtone pulsators. An

Trough photometric monitoring, we attempt to provide a catalogue of\nlong-period variables (LPVs), including Mira variables, semi-regular variables,\nand even irregular variables in NGC 147 and NGC185. We investigate the light\nvariations and compare the characteristics of these two LPV populations with\nthe results found for other galaxies such as the LMC. We carried out\ntime-series photometry in the i-band of the two target galaxies with the Nordic\nOptical Telescope (NOT), covering a time span of \\approx2.5 years. These data\nwere then combined with single-epoch K-band photometry, also obtained with the\nNOT. Narrow-band photometry data from the literature was used to distinguish\nbetween O-rich and C-rich stars. We report the detection of 513 LPVs in NGC185\nand 213 LPVs in NGC147, showing i-amplitudes of up to \\approx 2mag and periods\nranging between 90 and 800 days. The period-luminosity diagram for each of our\ntarget galaxies exhibits a well populated sequence of fundamental mode\npulsators. The resulting period-luminosity relations we obtained are compared\nto relations from the literature. We discuss the universality of those\nrelations because of which, as a side result, a correction of the distance\nmodulus of NGC185 may be necessary. Only one of our two galaxies, namely\nNGC185, has a significant fraction of possibly first overtone pulsators. An\ninterpretation of this finding in terms of differences in the star-formation\nhistories is suggested.'}","[{'name': 'D. Lorenz'}, {'name': 'T. Lebzelter'}, {'name': 'W. Nowotny'}, {'name': 'J.

results of Fourier decomposition of the time-series photometry of these stars

telescope. Fourier parameters based on ~18400 long-cadence observations per
star (and ~150000 short-cadence observations for FN Lyr and for AW Dra) are
derived. None of the stars shows the recently discovered `period-doubling'
effect seen in Blazhko variables; however, KIC 7021124 has been found to
pulsate simultaneously in the fundamental and second overtone modes with a
period ratio P2/P0 ~ 0.59305 and is similar to the double-mode star V350 Lyr.
Period change rates are derived from O-C diagrams spanning, in some cases, over
100 years; these are compared with high-precision periods derived from the
Kepler data alone. Extant Fourier correlations by Kovacs, Jurcsik et al. (with
minor transformations from the V to the Kp passband) have been used to derive
underlying physical characteristics for all the stars. This procedure seems to
be validated through comparisons of the Kepler variables with galactic and LMC
RR Lyr stars. The most metal-poor star in the sample is NR Lyr, with
[Fe/H]=-2.3 dex; and the four most metal-rich stars have [Fe/H] ranging from
-0.6 to +0.1 dex. Pulsational luminosities and masses are found to be

general characterization of the pulsational behaviour of A-F type stars as
observed in the Kepler light curves of a sample of 750 candidate A-F type
stars. We propose three main groups to describe the observed variety in
pulsating A-F type stars: gamma Dor, delta Sct, and hybrid stars. We assign 63%
of our sample to one of the three groups, and identify the remaining part as
rotationally modulated/active stars, binaries, stars of different spectral
type, or stars that show no clear periodic variability. 23% of the stars (171
stars) are hybrid stars, which is a much larger fraction than what has been
observed before. We characterize for the first time a large number of A-F type
stars (475 stars) in terms of number of detected frequencies, frequency range,
and typical pulsation amplitudes. The majority of hybrid stars show frequencies
with all kinds of periodicities within the gamma Dor and delta Sct range, also
between 5 and 10 c/d, which is a challenge for the current models. We find
indications for the existence of delta Sct and gamma Dor stars beyond the edges
of the current observational instability strips. The hybrid stars occupy the
entire region within the delta Sct and gamma Dor instability strips, and
beyond. Non-variable stars seem to exist within the instability strips. The
location of gamma Dor and delta Sct classes in the (Teff,logg)-diagram has been
extended. We investigate two newly constructed variables 'efficiency' and
'energy' as a means to explore the relation between gamma Dor and delta Sct

the kappa mechanism and convective blocking effect to drive hybrid pulsations.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""The Kepler spacecraft is providing time series of photometric data with\nmicromagnitude precision for hundreds of A-F type stars.

intrinsic interest for heliophysics and space-weather, e.g. the initiation of
coronal mass ejections, and the problem of mass loss of all stars. It is also
related to the physics of coronal neutral sheets and streamers, occurring above
lines of magnetic polarity reversal. Filaments and prominences correspond to
the cool coronal component of these regions.
  Aims: We examine the dynamical behaviour of these structures where
reconnection and dissipation of magnetic energy in the turbulent plasma are
occurring. The link between the observed oscillatory motions and the eruption
occurrence is investigated in detail for two different events.
  Method: Two filaments are analysed using two different datasets: time series
of spectra using a transition region line (He I at 584.33 A) and a coronal line
(Mg X at 609.79 A) measured with CDS on-board SOHO, observed on May 30, 2003,

I line at 630.25 nm with the Goettingen Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) that
are accompanied by imaging data at 431.3 nm and Ca II H. We apply both speckle
and (MO)MFBD techniques. We compare the spatial resolution and investigate the
impact of the reconstruction on spectral characteristics. The speckle
reconstruction and MFBD perform similar for our imaging data with nearly
identical intensity contrasts. MFBD provides a better and more homogeneous
resolution at the shortest wavelength. The MOMFBD and speckle deconvolution of
the intensity spectra lead to similar results, but our choice of settings for
the MOMFBD yields an intensity contrast smaller by about 2% at a comparable
spatial resolution. None of the reconstruction techniques introduces artifacts
in the intensity spectra. The speckle deconvolution (MOMFBD) has a rms noise in
V/I of 0.32% (0.20%). The deconvolved spectra thus require a high significance
threshold of about 1.0%. A comparison to spectra with a significantly higher
S/N ratio and to spectra from a MHD simulation reveals that the Goettingen FPI
can only detect about 30% of the polarization signal in quiet Sun. The
distribution of NCP values for the speckle-deconvolved data matches that of
observations with higher S/N better than MOMFBD, but shows seemingly
artificially sharp boundaries and unexpected changes of the sign. For the
spectropolarimetric data, the higher intensity contrast of the speckle

quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) from the lowest, i.e. radio, to the highest,

unclear which mechanism creates such QPPs. In this paper, we analyze four
bright solar flares which show compelling signatures of quasi-periodic behavior

satellite. Because GBM covers over 3 decades in energy (8 keV to 40 MeV) it can
be a key instrument to understand the physical processes which drive solar
flares. We tested for periodicity in the time series of the solar flares
observed by GBM by applying a classical periodogram analysis. However, contrary
to previous authors, we did not detrend the raw light curve before creating the
power spectral density spectrum (PSD). To assess the significance of the
frequencies we made use of a method which is commonly applied for X-ray
binaries and Seyfert galaxies. This technique takes into account the underlying
continuum of the PSD which for all of these sources has a P(f) ~ f^{-\alpha}

this technique by applying it to a solar flare which was observed by the Reuven
Ramaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) which contains, besides
any potential periodicity from the Sun, a 4 s rotational period due to the
rotation of the spacecraft around its axis. While we do not find an intrinsic
solar quasi-periodic pulsation we do reproduce the instrumental periodicity.
Moreover, with the method adopted here, we do not detect significant QPPs in

North-West limb. We observe coronal plasma shaped by magnetic field lines with
a negative curvature (U-shape) sitting at the bottom of a cavity. The cavity is
located just above the polar crown filament material. We thus observe the inner

cavity as a density depletion sitting above denser polar crown filament plasma
drained down the cavity due to gravity. As part of the polar crown filament,
plasma at different temperatures (ranging from 50000K to 0.6 MK) is observed at
the same location on the cavity dips and sustained by a competition between the

crown cavity as a solid body can be decomposed into two phases: a slow rise at
a speed of 0.6 km/s, and an acceleration phase at a mean speed of 25 km/s.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) was launched in February 2010 and is now\nproviding an unprecedented view of the solar activity at high spatial\nresolution and high cadence covering a broad range of temperature layers of the\natmosphere.

analysis of the white dwarf spectrum yields accretion rates that are consistent
with mass loss from the secondary due to a stellar wind. The second and
stronger Halpha component is attributed to stellar activity on the secondary

namely arbitrary-order Hilbert spectral analysis, to characterize the
scale-invariant properties of a time series directly in an amplitude-frequency
space. We first show numerically that due to a nonlinear distortion,
traditional methods require high-order harmonic components to represent
nonlinear processes, except for the Hilbert-based method. This will lead to an
artificial energy flux from the low-frequency (large scale) to the
high-frequency (small scale) part. Thus the power law, if it exists, is
contaminated. We then compare the Hilbert method with structure functions (SF),
detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and wavelet leader (WL) by analyzing
fractional Brownian motion and synthesized multifractal time series. For the
former simulation, we find that all methods provide comparable results. For the
latter simulation, we perform simulations with an intermittent parameter {\mu}
= 0.15. We find that the SF underestimates scaling exponent when q > 3. The
Hilbert method provides a slight underestimation when q > 5. However, both DFA
and WL overestimate the scaling exponents when q > 5. It seems that Hilbert and
DFA methods provide better singularity spectra than SF and WL. We finally apply
all methods to a passive scalar (temperature) data obtained from a jet
experiment with a Taylor's microscale Reynolds number Relambda \simeq 250. Due
to the presence of strong ramp-cliff structures, the SF fails to detect the
power law behavior. For the traditional method, the ramp-cliff structure causes
a serious artificial energy flux from the low-frequency (large scale) to the

MOST satellite and high-resolution spectra by SOPHIE. We apply on this unique
dataset a spot model to predict the activity-induced RV variations and compare
them with the observed ones. The model is based on the rotational modulation of
the stellar flux. A maximum entropy regularization is applied to find a unique

line profiles of the brightness perturbations due to dark spots and bright
faculae and the reduction of the convective blueshifts in the active regions.

modelling. They rotate with slightly different periods yielding a minimum
relative amplitude of the differential rotation of \Delta \Omega / \Omega =

monitoring of the two fastest late-type rotators in the nearby Beta Pictoris
moving group, HD199143 (F7V) and CD-641208 (K7V). The motivation for this work
is to investigate the rotation periods and photospheric spot patterns of these
very young stars, with a longer term view to probing the evolution of rotation
and magnetic activity during the early phases of main-sequence evolution. We
also aim to derive information on key physical parameters, such as rotational
velocity and rotation period. Methods: We applied maximum entropy (ME) and
Tikhonov regularizing (TR) criteria to derive the surface spot map
distributions of the optical modulation observed in HD199143 (F7 V) and
CD-641208 (K7V). We also used cross-correlation techniques to determine stellar
parameters such as radial velocities and rotational velocities. Lomb-Scargle
periodograms were used to obtain the rotational periods from differential
magnitude time series. Results: We find periods and inclinations of 0.356 days
and 21.5deg for HD199143, and 0.355 days and 50.1deg for CD-641208. The spot
maps of HD199143 obtained from the ME and TR methods are very similar, although
the latter gives a smoother distribution of the filling factor. Maps obtained
at two different epochs three weeks apart show a remarkable increase in spot
coverage amounting to ~7% of the surface of the photosphere over a time period
of only ~20 days. The spot maps of CD-641208 from the two methods show good
longitudinal agreement, whereas the latitude range of the spots is extended to
cover the whole visible hemisphere in the TR map. The distributions obtained
from the first light curve of HD199143 show the presence of an extended and
asymmetric active longitude with the maximum filling factor at longitude
~325degree.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Aims: We carried out high-resolution spectroscopy and BV(I)_C photometric\nmonitoring of the two fastest late-type rotators in the nearby Beta Pictoris\nmoving group, HD199143 (F7V) and CD-641208 (K7V).

the analysis of roll call data. We present a new data-driven model for roll
call voting that is geometric in nature. We construct the model by adapting the
""Partition Decoupling Method,"" an unsupervised learning technique originally
developed for the analysis of families of time series, to produce a multiscale
geometric description of a weighted network associated to a set of roll call
votes. Central to this approach is the quantitative notion of a ""motivation,"" a
cluster-based and learned basis element that serves as a building block in the
representation of roll call data. Motivations enable the formulation of a
quantitative description of ideology and their data-dependent nature makes
possible a quantitative analysis of the evolution of ideological factors. This
approach is generally applicable to roll call data and we apply it in
particular to the historical roll call voting of the U.S. House and Senate.
This methodology provides a mechanism for estimating the dimension of the
underlying action space. We determine that the dominant factors form a low-
(one- or two-) dimensional representation with secondary factors adding
higher-dimensional features. In this way our work supports and extends the
findings of both Poole-Rosenthal and Heckman-Snyder concerning the
dimensionality of the action space. We give a detailed analysis of several
individual Senates and use the AdaBoost technique from statistical learning to
determine those votes with the most powerful discriminatory value. When used as
a predictive model, this geometric view significantly outperforms spatial
models such as the Poole-Rosenthal DW-NOMINATE model and the Heckman-Snyder

We construct the model by adapting the\n""Partition Decoupling Method,"" an unsupervised learning technique originally\ndeveloped for the analysis of families of time series, to produce a multiscale\ngeometric description of a weighted network associated to a set of roll call\nvotes. Central to this approach is the quantitative notion of a ""motivation,"" a\ncluster-based and learned basis element that serves as a building block in the\nrepresentation of roll call data. Motivations enable the formulation of a\nquantitative description of ideology and their data-dependent nature makes\npossible a quantitative analysis of the evolution of ideological factors. This\napproach is generally applicable to roll call data and we apply it in\nparticular to the historical roll call voting of the U.S. House and Senate.\nThis methodology provides a mechanism for estimating the dimension of the\nunderlying action space. We determine that the dominant factors form a low-\n(one- or two-) dimensional representation with secondary factors adding\nhigher-dimensional features. In this way our work supports and extends the\nfindings of both Poole-Rosenthal and Heckman-Snyder concerning the\ndimensionality of the action space. We give a detailed analysis of several\nindividual Senates and use the AdaBoost technique from statistical learning to\ndetermine those votes with the most powerful discriminatory value. When used as\na predictive model, this geometric view significantly outperforms spatial\nmodels such as the Poole-Rosenthal DW-NOMINATE model and the Heckman-Snyder\n6-factor model, both in raw accuracy as well as Aggregate Proportional Reduced\nError (APRE).'}","[{'name': 'Greg Leibon'}, {'name': 'Scott Pauls'}, {'name': 'Daniel N.

coherence identifies the frequency bands that drive the direct linear

would first need an estimate of the spectral density matrix of the multivariate
time series. Parametric estimators of the spectral density matrix provide good
frequency resolution but could be sensitive when the parametric model is
misspecified. Smoothing-based nonparametric estimators are robust to model
misspecification and are consistent but may have poor frequency resolution. In

average of a parametric estimator and a nonparametric estimator. The optimal
weights are frequency-specific and derived under the quadratic risk criterion

The rms of the orbital solution is just 47 m/s, making it the most precise

spectra also indicate that there is an intermittent dependence on the orbital

of Zeeman sensitive/insensitive iron lines yield an average surface
magnetic-flux density of 542+-72 G. The time series for 2008 is modulated by
the stellar rotation as well as the orbital motion, such that the magnetic flux

is twice this value, 7.2c/d. Based on the assumption of slow rotation, we find
evidence that the two radial modes are the sixth and seventh overtones, and the

bright for its spectral type. In this study we discuss these characteristics

monitoring. From photometric time series obtained with the 2.2m telescope on
Calar Alto we measure a period of ~4d for FU Tau A, most likely the rotation
period. The short-term variations over a few days are consistent with the
rotational modulation of the flux by cool, magnetically induced spots. In
contrast, the photometric variability on timescales of weeks and years can only
be explained by the presence of hot spots, presumably caused by accretion. The
hot spot properties are thus variable on timescales exceeding the rotation
period, maybe due to long-term changes in the accretion rate or geometry. The
new constraints from the analysis of the variability confirm that FU Tau A is
affected by magnetically induced spots and excess luminosity from accretion.
However, accretion is not sufficient to explain its anomalous position in the
HR diagram. In addition, suppressed convection due to magnetic activity and/or
an early evolutionary stage need to be invoked to fully account for the
observed properties. These factors cause considerable problems in estimating
the mass of FU Tau A and other objects in this mass/age regime, to the extent

period from 1998 to 2009 was used, obtained from the NCEP/NOAA archive, and

proposed in Polnikov (2005). Based on buoy data for the Indian Ocean, the
fitting of the modified model WAM was done, which provides the win in accuracy
of calculations on 35%, in comparison with the original model. All the further
calculations of the wave fields in IO were made for these model settings. At

fields of the significant wave height <Hs(x,y,T,R)> and the wave energy
<Ea(x,y,T,R>, calculated with different scales of averaging in time T and space
R; b) estimating the fields of seasonal, annual and long-term variability; and
c) determining the 12-year trend of the annually averaged fields. The analysis
was carried out taking into account the previously introduced zoning the ocean

estimate the stored energy of the wave field in the Indian Ocean and the scales

model selection technique defined as a fixed point reached by iterating a
likelihood gradient-based thresholding function. The smooth James-Stein
thresholding function has two regularization parameters $\lambda$ and $\nu$,
and a smoothness parameter $s$. It enjoys smoothness like ridge regression and
selects variables like lasso. Focusing on Gaussian regression, we show that
SBITE is uniquely defined, and that its Stein unbiased risk estimate is a
smooth function of $\lambda$ and $\nu$, for better selection of the two
regularization parameters. We perform a Monte-Carlo simulation to investigate
the predictive and oracle properties of this smooth version of adaptive lasso.
  The motivation is a gravitational wave burst detection problem from several
concomitant time series. A nonparametric wavelet-based estimator is developed
to combine information from all captors by block-thresholding multiresolution

  Methodology/Principal Findings: A bipartite network of emotional agents and

emotion state of an agent,quantified by the arousal and the valence, fluctuates
in time due to events on the connected posts, and in the moments of agent's
action it is transferred to a selected post. We claim that the indirect
communication of the emotion in the model rules, combined with the action-delay
time and the circadian rhythm extracted from the empirical data, can explain
the genesis of emotional bursts by users on popular Blogs and similar Web
portals. The model also identifies the parameters and how they influence the
course of the dynamics.
  Conclusions: The collective behavior is here recognized by the emergence of
communities on the network and the fractal time-series of their emotional

We found that including the average\nsmall frequency separation improves the determination of the age only for KIC\n11395018 and KIC 11234888, and for the latter this improvement was due to the\nlack of strong atmospheric constraints.

diagnostics to discriminate whether the observed Doppler shifts are caused by
stellar surface inhomogeneities or by the radial pull of orbiting planets. We
recover the planetary signals corresponding to 9 planets already announced by
our group (Gl176b, Gl581b, c, d & e, Gl674b, Gl433b, Gl 667Cb and c). We
present radial velocities that confirm GJ 849 hosts a Jupiter-mass planet, plus
a long-term radial-velocity variation. We also present RVs that precise the
planetary mass and period of Gl 832b. We detect long-term RV changes for Gl
367, Gl 680 and Gl 880 betraying yet unknown long-period companions. We
identify candidate signals in the radial-velocity time series and demonstrate

high-quality spectropolarimetric time-series observations, covering a full
rotational period of the star. Spectra were obtained with the HARPSpol at the
ESO 3.6-m telescope. Combining information from all suitable spectral lines, we
set an upper limit of 4 G on the mean longitudinal magnetic field. For chemical
spots, an upper limit on the longitudinal field varies between 8 and 15 G. We
confirmed the variability of Y, Sr, and Ti and detected variability in Cr
lines. Stratification analysis showed that Y and Ti are not concentrated in the
uppermost atmospheric layers. Our spectropolarimetric observations rule out the
presence of a strong, globally-organised magnetic field in phi Phe. This
implies an alternative mechanism of spot formation, which could be related to a

monitoring survey of ~50,000 stars in the Lagoon Nebula \ion{H}{2} region. This
first paper presents rotation periods for 290 low-mass stars in NGC 6530, the
young cluster illuminating the nebula, and for which we assemble a catalog of
infrared and spectroscopic disk indicators, estimated masses and ages, and
X-ray luminosities. The distribution of rotation periods we measure is broadly
uniform for 0.5 < P < 10 d; the short-period cutoff corresponds to breakup. We
observe no obvious bimodality in the period distribution, but we do find that
stars with disk signatures rotate more slowly on average. The stars' X-ray
luminosities are roughly flat with rotation period, at the saturation level
($\log L_X / L_{\rm bol} \approx -3.3$). However, we find a significant
positive correlation between $L_X / L_{\rm bol}$ and co-rotation radius,
suggesting that the observed X-ray luminosities are regulated by centrifugal
stripping of the stellar coronae. The period-mass relationship in NGC 6530 is
broadly similar to that of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), but the slope of the
relationship among the slowest rotators differs from that in the ONC and other
young clusters. We show that the slope of the period-mass relationship for the
slowest rotators can be used as a proxy for the age of a young cluster, and we
argue that NGC 6530 may be slightly younger than the ONC, making it a
particularly important touchstone for models of angular momentum evolution in
young, low-mass stars.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""We have conducted a long-term, wide-field, high-cadence photometric\nmonitoring survey of ~50,000 stars in the Lagoon Nebula \\ion{H}{2} region.

several solar-type stars.
  We study the variations of stellar p-mode linewidth as a function of
effective temperature.
  Time series of 9 months of Kepler data have been used. The power spectra of
42 cool main-sequence stars and subgiants have been analysed using both Maximum
Likelihood Estimators and Bayesian estimators, providing individual mode
characteristics such as frequencies, linewidths and mode heights.
  Here we report on the mode linewidth at maximum power and at maximum mode
height for these 42 stars as a function of effective temperature.
  We show that the mode linewidth at either maximum mode height or maximum
amplitude follows a scaling relation with effective temperature, which is a
combination of a power law plus a lower bound. The typical power law index is
about 13 for the linewidth derived from the maximum mode height, and about 16

the forecast of output its error for renewable energies and the demand response

photovoltaic systems (PV), and wind farms and analyze the effect of the
forecast error on the operation cost and reserves. We confirm that the
operation cost was increases with the forecast error. The effect of a sudden
decrease in wind power is also analyzed. More thermal power plants need to be
operated to generate power to absorb this sudden decrease in wind power. The
increase in the number of operating thermal power plants within a short period
does not affect the total operation cost significantly; however the
substitution of thermal power plants by wind farms or PV systems is not
expected to be very high. Finally, the effects of the demand response in the
case of a sudden decrease in wind power are analyzed. We confirm that the
number of operating thermal power plants is reduced by the demand response. A
power utility has to continue thermal power plants for ensuring supply-demand

analysis of luteinizing hormone (LH) pulsatile secretion by the pituitary
gland. Whereas measurements in the cavernous sinus cumulate anatomical and
technical difficulties, LH levels can be easily assessed from jugular blood.
However, plasma levels result from a convolution process due to clearance
effects when LH enters the general circulation. Simultaneous measurements
comparing LH levels in the cavernous sinus and jugular blood have revealed
clear differences in the pulse shape, the amplitude and the baseline. Besides,
experimental sampling occurs at a relatively low frequency (typically every 10
min) with respect to LH highest frequency release (one pulse per hour) and the
resulting LH measurements are noised by both experimental and assay errors. As
a result, the pattern of plasma LH may be not so clearly pulsatile. Yet,
reliable information on the InterPulse Intervals (IPI) is a prerequisite to
study precisely the steroid feedback exerted on the pituitary level. Hence,
there is a real need for robust IPI detection algorithms. In this article, we

electrophysiological assays has remained technically unfeasible even in
dissociated neuronal cultures. We introduce an improved algorithmic approach
based on Transfer Entropy to reconstruct approximations to network structural
connectivities from network activity monitored through calcium fluorescence
imaging. Based on information theory, our method requires no prior assumptions
on the statistics of neuronal firing and neuronal connections. The performance
of our algorithm is benchmarked on surrogate time-series of calcium
fluorescence generated by the simulated dynamics of a network with known
ground-truth topology. We find that the effective network topology revealed by
Transfer Entropy depends qualitatively on the time-dependent dynamic state of
the network (e.g., bursting or non-bursting). We thus demonstrate how
conditioning with respect to the global mean activity improves the performance
of our method. [...] Compared to other reconstruction strategies such as
cross-correlation or Granger Causality methods, our method based on improved
Transfer Entropy is remarkably more accurate. In particular, it provides a good
reconstruction of the network clustering coefficient, allowing to discriminate
between weakly or strongly clustered topologies, whereas on the other hand an
approach based on cross-correlations would invariantly detect artificially high
levels of clustering. Finally, we present the applicability of our method to
real recordings of in vitro cortical cultures. We demonstrate that these

by studying its dynamics in the time-frequency domain. The novelty of our
approach lies in the application of wavelet tools to commodity market data. A
major part of economic time series analysis is done in the time or frequency
domain separately. Wavelet analysis combines these two fundamental approaches
allowing study of the time series in the time- frequency domain. Using this
framework, we propose a new, model-free way of estimating time-varying cor-
relations. In the empirical analysis, we connect our approach to the dynamic
conditional correlation approach of Engle (2002) on the main components of the
energy sector. Namely, we use crude oil, gasoline, heating oil, and natural gas
on a nearest-future basis over a period of approximately 16 and 1/2 years

the transiting exoplanet HD 189733b, using Wide Field Camera 3. This consists
of time-series spectra of two transits, used to measure the wavelength
dependence of the planetary radius. These observations aim to test whether the
Rayleigh scattering haze detected at optical wavelengths extends into the
near-infrared, or if it becomes transparent leaving molecular features to
dominate the transmission spectrum. Due to saturation and non-linearity
affecting the brightest (central) pixels of the spectrum, light curves were
extracted from the blue and red ends of the spectra only, corresponding to
wavelength ranges of 1.099-1.168 um and 1.521-1.693 um, respectively, for the
first visit, and 1.082-1.128 um and 1.514-1.671 um for the second. The light
curves were fitted using a Gaussian process model to account for instrumental
systematics whilst simultaneously fitting for the transit parameters. This

stars from the photometric irregular time-sampling of the ESA Gaia mission,
currently scheduled for launch in 2013, taking into account its dependence on
ecliptic coordinates. We examine the case of solar-twins as well as thousands
of synthetic time-series of solar-like stars rotating faster than the Sun. In
the case of solar twins we assume that the Gaia unfiltered photometric passband
G will mimic the variability of the total solar irradiance (TSI) as measured by
the VIRGO experiment. For stars rotating faster than the Sun, light-curves are
simulated using synthetic spectra for the quiet atmosphere, the spots, and the
faculae combined by applying semi-empirical relationships relating the level of
photospheric magnetic activity to the stellar rotation and the Gaia
instrumental response. The capabilities of the Deeming, Lomb-Scargle, and Phase
Dispersion Minimisation methods in recovering the correct rotation periods are
tested and compared. The false alarm probability (FAP) is computed using Monte
Carlo simulations and compared with analytical formulae. The Gaia scanning law
makes the rate of correct detection of rotation periods strongly dependent on
the ecliptic latitude (beta). We find that for P ~ 1 d, the rate of correct
detection increases with ecliptic latitude from 20-30 per cent at beta ~

structure of their nuclei, which can either be homogeneous or heterogeneous.
The nucleus structure can be conveniently studied at millimeter wavelengths,
using velocity-resolved spectral time series of the emission lines, obtained
simultaneously for multiple molecules as the body rotates. Using this
technique, we investigated the sources of CH3OH and HCN in comet 103P/Hartley
2, the target of NASA's EPOXI mission, which had an exceptionally favorable

varying production rates generate changes in brightness by a factor of 4 for
HCN and by a factor of 2 for CH3OH, and they are remarkably well correlated in
time. With the addition of the velocity information from the line profiles, we
identify the main sources of outgassing: two jets, oppositely directed in a
radial sense, and icy grains, injected into the coma primarily through one of
the jets. The mixing ratio of CH3OH and HCN is dramatically different in the
two jets, which evidently shows large-scale chemical heterogeneity of the
nucleus. We propose a network of identities linking the two jets with
morphological features reported elsewhere, and postulate that the chemical
heterogeneity may result from thermal evolution. The model-dependent average
production rates are 3.5x10**26 molec/s for CH3OH and 1.25x10**25 molec/s for

only a limited sample of them well understood enough from an
asteroseismological point of view to provide feedback on the current
evolutionary models. Our study adds one special case to this sample, with more
observational constraints than for most of these stars.
  Aims. Our goal is to analyse and interpret the pulsational behaviour of the
B3 IV star HD 43317 using the CoRoT light curve along with the ground-based
spectroscopy gathered by the Harps instrument. This way we continue our efforts
to map the Beta Cep and SPB instability strips.
  Methods. We used different techniques to reveal the abundances and
fundamental stellar parameters from the newly-obtained high-resolution spectra.
We used various time-series analysis tools to explore the nature of variations
present in the light curve. We calculated the moments and used the
pixel-by-pixel method to look for line profile variations in the
high-resolution spectra.
  Results. We find that HD 43317 is a single fast rotator (v_rot ~ 50% v_crit)
and hybrid SPB/Beta Cep-type pulsator with Solar metal abundances. We interpret
the variations in photometry and spectroscopy as a result of rotational
modulation connected to surface inhomogeneities, combined with the presence of
both g and p mode pulsations. We detect a series of ten consecutive frequencies

services to determine what relevant data is available from each service; the
candidate datasets available are described uniformly in a VOTable format
document which is returned in response to the query. Finally, the client may
retrieve selected datasets for analysis. Spectrum datasets returned by an SSA
spectrum service may be either precomputed, archival datasets, or they may be
virtual data which is computed on the fly to respond to a client request.
Spectrum datasets may conform to a standard data model defined by SSA, or may
be native spectra with custom project-defined content. Spectra may be returned
in any of a number of standard data formats. Spectral data is generally stored
externally to the VO in a format specific to each spectral data collection;
currently there is no standard way to represent astronomical spectra, and
virtually every project does it differently. Hence spectra may be actively

The form of\nthe SSA interface is simple: clients first query the global resource registry\nto find services of interest and then issue a data discovery query to selected\nservices to determine what relevant data is available from each service; the\ncandidate datasets available are described uniformly in a VOTable format\ndocument which is returned in response to the query. Finally, the client may\nretrieve selected datasets for analysis. Spectrum datasets returned by an SSA\nspectrum service may be either precomputed, archival datasets, or they may be\nvirtual data which is computed on the fly to respond to a client request.\nSpectrum datasets may conform to a standard data model defined by SSA, or may\nbe native spectra with custom project-defined content. Spectra may be returned\nin any of a number of standard data formats. Spectral data is generally stored\nexternally to the VO in a format specific to each spectral data collection;\ncurrently there is no standard way to represent astronomical spectra, and\nvirtually every project does it differently. Hence spectra may be actively\nmediated to the standard SSA-defined data model at access time by the service,\nso that client analysis programs do not have to be familiar with the\nidiosyncratic details of each data collection to be accessed.'}","[{'name': 'Doug Tody'}, {'name': 'Markus Dolensky'}, {'name': 'Jonathan McDowell'}, {'name': 'Francois Bonnarel'}, {'name': 'Tamas Budavari'}, {'name': 'Ivo Busko'}, {'name': 'Alberto Micol'}, {'name': 'Pedro Osuna'}, {'name': 'Jesus Salgado'}, {'name': 'Petr Skoda'}, {'name': 'Randy Thompson'}, {'name': 'Frank Valdes'}, {'name': 'the Data Access Layer working group'}]",{'name': 'the Data Access Layer working group'},the Data Access Layer working group,10.5479/ADS/bib/2012ivoa.spec.0210T,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.5479/ADS/bib/2012ivoa.spec.0210T', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5725v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.5725v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,,"{'term': 'astro-ph.IM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'astro-ph.IM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",

on the height of star A above or below the razor sharp edge of the occulting

ingress to an enhanced double-peaked profile, with both a blue and red emission

important in many circumstances, in particular to apply efficient maximum
likelihood methods, obtain consistent estimates of partial effects and

runaways from clusters, i.e., their current isolation does not reflect their

their sight lines are associated with gaseous and/or dusty filaments in the

black hole system GRS 1915+105, a strongly variable microquasar commonly used
for studying relativistic jets and the physics of black hole accretion. The
analysis of sample observations for 13 different states in both soft (low) and
hard (high) energy bands is performed by flicker-noise spectroscopy (FNS), a
phenomenological time series analysis method operating on structure functions
and power spectrum estimates. We find the values of FNS parameters, including
the Hurst exponent, flicker-noise parameter, and characteristic time scales,
for each observation based on multiple 2,500-second continuous data segments.
We identify four modes of stochastic variability driven by dissipative
processes that may be related to viscosity fluctuations in the accretion disk
around the black hole: random (RN), power-law (1F), one-scale (1S), and

time series of calibrated skylight profiles. The evolution of the sky
brightness thus calibrated also shows good consistency with the eclipse,

brightness in each local sky region took place within half a minute from the
corresponding predicted contact time. Such small time delays were mainly caused
by occasional cirri. The minimal sky brightness measured during the eclipse is
a few millionths of I\odot with standard deviation of 0.11 millionths of

`tipping point', or whether it will do so in the future. Several recent studies
argue that the loss of summer sea ice does not involve an irreversible
bifurcation, because it is highly reversible in models. However, a broader
definition of a `tipping point' also includes other abrupt, non-linear changes
that are neither bifurcations nor necessarily irreversible. Examination of
satellite data for Arctic sea-ice area reveals an abrupt increase in the
amplitude of seasonal variability in 2007 that has persisted since then. We
identified this abrupt transition using recently developed methods that can
detect multi-modality in time-series data and sometimes forewarn of
bifurcations. When removing the mean seasonal cycle (up to 2008) from the
satellite data, the residual sea-ice fluctuations switch from uni-modal to
multi-modal behaviour around 2007. We originally interpreted this as a
bifurcation in which a new lower ice cover attractor appears in deseasonalised
fluctuations and is sampled in every summer-autumn from 2007 onwards. However,
this interpretation is clearly sensitive to how the seasonal cycle is removed
from the raw data, and to the presence of continental land masses restricting
winter-spring ice fluctuations. Furthermore, there was no robust early warning
signal of critical slowing down prior to the hypothesized bifurcation. Early
warning indicators do however show destabilization of the summer-autumn sea-ice
cover since 2007. Thus, the bifurcation hypothesis lacks consistent support,
but there was an abrupt and persistent increase in the amplitude of the

enabled the detection of three pulsation frequencies, the first harmonic of the
strongest signal, and the rotation frequency with its first harmonic.
Pulsational mode identification from analysing the colour amplitude ratios
confirms the dominant mode as being radial, whereas the other two oscillations
are most likely l=4. Combining seismic constraints on the inclination of the
rotation axis with published magnetic field analyses we conclude that the
radial mode must be the fundamental. The rotational light modulation is in
phase with published spectroscopic variability, and consistent with an oblique
rotator for which both magnetic poles pass through the line of sight. The

inference is simple in the sense that both the number of factors and the factor
loadings are estimated in terms of an eigenanalysis for a nonnegative definite
matrix, and is therefore applicable when the dimension of time series is on the
order of a few thousands. Asymptotic properties of the proposed method are
investigated under two settings: (i) the sample size goes to infinity while the
dimension of time series is fixed; and (ii) both the sample size and the
dimension of time series go to infinity together. In particular, our estimators
for zero-eigenvalues enjoy faster convergence (or slower divergence) rates,
hence making the estimation for the number of factors easier. In particular,
when the sample size and the dimension of time series go to infinity together,
the estimators for the eigenvalues are no longer consistent. However, our
estimator for the number of the factors, which is based on the ratios of the
estimated eigenvalues, still works fine. Furthermore, this estimation shows the
so-called ""blessing of dimensionality"" property in the sense that the
performance of the estimation may improve when the dimension of time series
increases. A two-step procedure is investigated when the factors are of
different degrees of strength. Numerical illustration with both simulated and

In particular, our estimators\nfor zero-eigenvalues enjoy faster convergence (or slower divergence) rates,\nhence making the estimation for the number of factors easier. In particular,\nwhen the sample size and the dimension of time series go to infinity together,\nthe estimators for the eigenvalues are no longer consistent. However, our\nestimator for the number of the factors, which is based on the ratios of the\nestimated eigenvalues, still works fine. Furthermore, this estimation shows the\nso-called ""blessing of dimensionality"" property in the sense that the\nperformance of the estimation may improve when the dimension of time series\nincreases. A two-step procedure is investigated when the factors are of\ndifferent degrees of strength. Numerical illustration with both simulated and\nreal data is also reported.'}","[{'name': 'Clifford Lam'}, {'name': 'Qiwei Yao'}]",{'name': 'Qiwei Yao'},Qiwei Yao,10.1214/12-AOS970,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/12-AOS970', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0613v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.0613v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","Published in at http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/12-AOS970 the Annals of

origins that may induce ligand dependence of rate constants. Using aggregated
Markov models, we show under the condition of detailed balance that
non-fluorescent bindings and missed events due to transient interactions,
instead of conformation fluctuations, may underly the dependence of waiting

waiting times are rational functions of ligand concentration. The shape of
concentration dependence is qualitatively affected by the number of binding
sites in the single molecule and is quantitatively tuned by model parameters.

propose a model that, in the time domain, modulates the covariance of
cyclostationary processes and consequently broadens their frequency support in

the estimation risk.

across trials, we carefully take into account the bias that may be introduced

star NGC 1624-2, yielding important new constraints on its spectral and
physical characteristics, rotation, magnetic field strength, X-ray emission and

{\simeq} 30 M{\odot}, and infer an effective temperature of 35 {\pm} 2 kK and
log g = 4.0 {\pm} 0.2. Based on an extensive time series of optical spectral
observations we report significant variability of a large number of spectral
lines, and infer a unique period of 157.99 {\pm} 0.94 d which we interpret as
the rotational period of the star. We report the detection of a very strong -
5.35 {\pm} 0.5 kG - longitudinal magnetic field <Bz>, coupled with probable
Zeeman splitting of Stokes I profiles of metal lines confirming a surface field
modulus <B> of 14 {\pm} 1 kG, consistent with a surface dipole of polar
strength >~ 20 kG. This is the largest magnetic field ever detected in an
O-type star, and the first report of Zeeman splitting of Stokes I profiles in
such an object. We also report the detection of reversed Stokes V profiles

may form in the close magnetosphere of the star. We analyze archival Chandra

high-level representation of the inputs given only unlabeled data; it

coding has also been shown to be useful for self-taught learning, in which the
goal is to solve a supervised classification task given access to additional

learning problem. Shift-invariant sparse coding (SISC) is an extension of
sparse coding which reconstructs a (usually time-series) input using all of the

algorithm for learning SISC bases. Our method is based on iteratively solving
two large convex optimization problems: The first, which computes the linear
coefficients, is an L1-regularized linear least squares problem with

a heuristic to select a small subset of the variables to optimize, but we

solves for bases, is a constrained linear least squares problem. By optimizing
over complex-valued variables in the Fourier domain, we reduce the coupling

and EQ Peg, obtained from time-series analyses. The phases, computed at
intervals of 0.10 phase length, where the mean flare occurence rates to obtain
maximum amplitude; also, the phases of rotational modulation were compared in
order to investigate whether there is any longitudinal relation between stellar
flares and spots. Although the results show that flare events are related with
spotted areas on stellar surfaces during some of the observing seasons, we did
not find any clear correlation among them. Finally, it was tested whether slow
flares are fast flares occurring on the opposite side of the stars according to
the direction of the observers, as mentioned in a hypothesis developed by <A
>Gurzadyan (1986)</A>. The flare occurence rates reveal that both slow and fast
flares can occur in any rotational phases. The flare occurence rates of both
fast and slow flares vary in the same way along the longitudes for all program
stars. These results are not expected based on the case mentioned in the
hypothesis.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=2000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'In this study, we considered stellar spots, stellar flares, and also the\nrelation between these two magnetic proccesses that take place on UV Cet stars.\nIn addition, the hypothesis about slow flares described by Gurzadyan (1986\nAp&SS, 125, 127) was investigated.
