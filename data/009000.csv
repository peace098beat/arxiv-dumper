submillimeter spectroscopy using a heterodyne receiver equipped with a
frequency-modulating local oscillator (FMLO). Unlike conventional switching
methods, which extract astronomical signals by subtracting the reference
spectra of off-sources from those of on-sources, the FMLO method does not need
to obtain any off-source spectra; rather, it estimates them from the on-source
spectra themselves. The principle is a high dump-rate (10 Hz) spectroscopy with
radio frequency modulation (FM) achieved by fast sweeping of a local oscillator
(LO) of a heterodyne receiver: Because sky emission (i.e., off-source)
fluctuates as $1/f$-type and is spectrally correlated, it can be estimated and
subtracted from time-series spectra (a timestream) by principal component
analysis. Meanwhile astronomical signals remain in the timestream since they
are modulated to a higher time-frequency domain. The FMLO method therefore
achieves (1) a remarkably high observation efficiency, (2) reduced spectral
baseline wiggles, and (3) software-based sideband separation. We developed an
FMLO system for the Nobeyama 45-m telescope and a data reduction procedure for
it. Frequency modulation was realized by a tunable and programmable first local
oscillator. With observations of Galactic sources, we demonstrate that the
observation efficiency of the FMLO method is dramatically improved compared to
conventional switching methods. Specifically, we find that the time to achieve
the same noise level is reduced by a factor of 3.0 in single-pointed
observations and by a factor of 1.2 in mapping observations. The FMLO method
can be applied to observations of fainter ($\sim$mK) spectral lines and larger
($\sim$deg$^{2}$) mapping. It would offer much more efficient and
baseline-stable observations compared to conventional switching methods.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We propose a new observing method for single-dish millimeter and\nsubmillimeter spectroscopy using a heterodyne receiver equipped with a\nfrequency-modulating local oscillator (FMLO).

  To investigate these areas we implement a long short-term memory (LSTM) based
intrusion detection system (IDS) which effectively detects cyber-physical
attacks on a water treatment testbed representing a strong baseline IDS.
  For investigating adversarial attacks we model two different white box
attackers. The first attacker is able to manipulate sensor readings on a subset
of the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system. By creating a stream of
adversarial data the attacker is able to hide the cyber-physical attacks from
the IDS. For the cyber-physical attacks which are detected by the IDS, the
attacker required on average 2.48 out of 12 total sensors to be compromised for
the cyber-physical attacks to be hidden from the IDS. The second attacker model
we explore is an $L_{\infty}$ bounded attacker who can send fake readings to
the IDS, but to remain imperceptible, limits their perturbations to the
smallest $L_{\infty}$ value needed.

due to the requirement of domain knowledge and subject matter expertise. This
paper is to resolve this dilemma by answering two questions: (1) provided with
a limited number of reliable labels, can we use them to generate more synthetic
labels; (2) Can we use those synthetic labels to improve the detectability?
Among all the existing generative models, the generative adversarial network
(GAN) shows its supreme capability in generating high-quality synthetic samples
in multiple domains. We designed our model based on GAN. In particular, we
studied several different network structures. By comparing the generated
results, our GAN-based generative model yields the highest quality. We further
combine the dataset with synthetic samples generated by our generative model
and show that the detectability of our earthquake classification model is
significantly improved than the one trained without augmenting the training
set.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Detecting earthquake events from seismic time series has proved itself a\nchallenging task.

the use of machine-learning emulators, which are algorithms for
high-dimensional interpolation. These use a pre-calculated training dataset to
mimic the output of a complex code but with run times orders of magnitude
shorter. We present the application of such an emulator to synthetic type II

results show that with a relatively small training set of 780 spectra we can
generate emulated spectra with interpolation uncertainties of less than one

fitting of two well-known type IIP supernovae; as an exemplary application, we
determine the supernova distances from the spectral fits using the

IV. Limits of\n  the correction of radial velocities using chromospheric emission'}","Inhibition of the convective blueshift in active regions is a major
contribution to the radial velocity variations, at least for solar-like stars.
A common technique to correct for this component is to model the RV as a linear
function of chromospheric emission, because both are strongly correlated with
the coverage by plages. This correction is not perfect: the aim of the present
study is to understand the limits of this correction and to improve it. We
investigate these questions by analysing a large set of synthetic time series
corresponding to old main sequence F6-K4 stars modelled using a consistent set
of parameters. We focus here on the analysis of the correlation between time
series, in particular between RV and chromospheric emission on different
timescales. We also study the temporal variation for each time series.
Inclination strongly impacts these correlations, as well as additional signals
(granulation and supergranulation). Although RV and LogR'HK are often well
correlated, a combination of geometrical effects (butterfly diagrams related to
dynamo processes and inclination) and activity level variations over time
create an hysteresis pattern during the cycle, which produces a departure from
an excellent correlation: for a given activity level, the RV is higher or lower
during the ascending phase compared to the descending phase of the cycle
depending on inclination, with a reversal for inclinations about 60 deg from
pole-on. This hysteresis is also observed for the Sun and other stars. This
property is due to the spatio-temporal distribution of the activity pattern and
to the difference in projection effects of the RV and chromospheric emission.
These results allow us to propose a new method which significantly improves the
correction for long timescales, and could be crucial to improving detection
rates of planets in the habitable zone around F6-K4 stars.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""Inhibition of the convective blueshift in active regions is a major\ncontribution to the radial velocity variations, at least for solar-like stars.\nA common technique to correct for this component is to model the RV as a linear\nfunction of chromospheric emission, because both are strongly correlated with\nthe coverage by plages.

We focus here on the analysis of the correlation between time\nseries, in particular between RV and chromospheric emission on different\ntimescales. We also study the temporal variation for each time series.\nInclination strongly impacts these correlations, as well as additional signals\n(granulation and supergranulation). Although RV and LogR'HK are often well\ncorrelated, a combination of geometrical effects (butterfly diagrams related to\ndynamo processes and inclination) and activity level variations over time\ncreate an hysteresis pattern during the cycle, which produces a departure from\nan excellent correlation: for a given activity level, the RV is higher or lower\nduring the ascending phase compared to the descending phase of the cycle\ndepending on inclination, with a reversal for inclinations about 60 deg from\npole-on. This hysteresis is also observed for the Sun and other stars. This\nproperty is due to the spatio-temporal distribution of the activity pattern and\nto the difference in projection effects of the RV and chromospheric emission.\nThese results allow us to propose a new method which significantly improves the\ncorrection for long timescales, and could be crucial to improving detection\nrates of planets in the habitable zone around F6-K4 stars.""}","[{'name': 'Nadège Meunier'}, {'name': 'Anne-Marie Lagrange'}, {'name': 'Sylvain Cuzacq'}]",{'name': 'Sylvain Cuzacq'},Sylvain Cuzacq,10.1051/0004-6361/201935348,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201935348', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05319v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05319v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.EP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]","Paper accepted in Astronomy and astrophysics, 15 pages",

(3D) magnetic field in active region 12371 producing an eruptive M6.5 flare in
2015 June 22. In order to reveal the 3D magnetic structure, we first
extrapolated the 3D coronal magnetic fields based on time series of the
photospheric vector magnetic fields under a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF)
approximation. The NLFFFs nicely reproduced the observed sigmoidal structure
which is widely considered to be preeruptive magnetic configuration. In
particular, we found that the sigmoid is composed of two branches of sheared
arcade loops. On the basis of the NLFFFs, we investigated the sheared arcade
loops to explore the onset process of the eruptive flare using three
representative magnetohydrodynamic instabilities: the kink, torus, and double
arc instabilities (DAI). The DAI, recently proposed by Ishiguro & Kusano, is a
double arc loop that can be more easily destabilized than a torus loop.
Consequently, the NLFFFs are found to be quite stable against the kink and
torus instabilities. However, the sheared arcade loops formed prior to the
flare possibly become unstable against the DAI. As a possible scenario for the
onset process of the M6.5 flare, we suggest a three-step process: (1) double
arc loops are formed by the sheared arcade loops through the tether-cutting
reconnection during an early phase of the flare, (2) the DAI contributes to the
expansion of destabilized double arc loops, and (3) finally, the torus
instability makes the full eruption.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We studied a flare onset process in terms of stability of a three-dimensional\n(3D) magnetic field in active region 12371 producing an eruptive M6.5 flare in\n2015 June 22.

one dynamical regime to another. In the climate system, the atmospheric
boundary layer can experience sudden transitions between fully turbulent states
and quiescent, quasi-laminar states. Such rapid transitions are observed in
Polar regions or at night when the atmospheric boundary layer is stably
stratified, and they have important consequences in the strength of mixing with
the higher levels of the atmosphere. To analyze the stable boundary layer, many
approaches rely on the identification of regimes that are commonly denoted as
weakly and very stable regimes. Detecting transitions between the regimes is
crucial for modeling purposes. In this work a combination of methods from
dynamical systems and statistical modeling is applied to study these regime
transitions and to develop an early-warning signal that can be applied to
non-stationary field data. The presented metric aims at detecting nearing
transitions by statistically quantifying the deviation from the dynamics
expected when the system is close to a stable equilibrium. An idealized
stochastic model of near-surface inversions is used to evaluate the potential
of the metric as an indicator of regime transitions. In this stochastic system,
small-scale perturbations can be amplified due to the nonlinearity, resulting
in transitions between two possible equilibria of the temperature inversion.
The simulations show such noise-induced regime transitions, successfully

In the climate system, the atmospheric\nboundary layer can experience sudden transitions between fully turbulent states\nand quiescent, quasi-laminar states. Such rapid transitions are observed in\nPolar regions or at night when the atmospheric boundary layer is stably\nstratified, and they have important consequences in the strength of mixing with\nthe higher levels of the atmosphere. To analyze the stable boundary layer, many\napproaches rely on the identification of regimes that are commonly denoted as\nweakly and very stable regimes. Detecting transitions between the regimes is\ncrucial for modeling purposes. In this work a combination of methods from\ndynamical systems and statistical modeling is applied to study these regime\ntransitions and to develop an early-warning signal that can be applied to\nnon-stationary field data. The presented metric aims at detecting nearing\ntransitions by statistically quantifying the deviation from the dynamics\nexpected when the system is close to a stable equilibrium. An idealized\nstochastic model of near-surface inversions is used to evaluate the potential\nof the metric as an indicator of regime transitions. In this stochastic system,\nsmall-scale perturbations can be amplified due to the nonlinearity, resulting\nin transitions between two possible equilibria of the temperature inversion.\nThe simulations show such noise-induced regime transitions, successfully\nidentified by the indicator.

literature. In order to prepare longitudinal, irregularly sampled, clinical

the time series data to short, regular intervals and use

Typically, they will not maintain any explicit information about which values
were imputed. In this work, we (1) call attention to this practice and discuss
its potential implications; (2) propose an alternative representation of the

patterns between different brain regions on the analysis of the correlations of
their functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) time series - an object thus
constrained by construction to belong to the manifold of symmetric positive
definite matrices. One of the challenges that naturally arises consists of
finding a lower-dimensional subspace for representing such manifold-valued
data. Traditional techniques, like principal component analysis, are
ill-adapted to tackle non-Euclidean spaces and may fail to achieve a
lower-dimensional representation of the data - thus potentially pointing to the
absence of lower-dimensional representation of the data. However, these
techniques are restricted in that: (i) they do not leverage the assumption that
the connectomes belong on a pre-specified manifold, therefore discarding
information; (ii) they can only fit a linear subspace to the data. In this
paper, we are interested in variants to learn potentially highly curved
submanifolds of manifold-valued data. Motivated by the brain connectomes
example, we investigate a latent variable generative model, which has the added
benefit of providing us with uncertainty estimates - a crucial quantity in the
medical applications we are considering. While latent variable models have been
proposed to learn linear and nonlinear spaces for Euclidean data, or geodesic
subspaces for manifold data, no intrinsic latent variable model exists to learn
nongeodesic subspaces for manifold data. This paper fills this gap and
formulates a Riemannian variational autoencoder with an intrinsic generative
model of manifold-valued data. We evaluate its performances on synthetic and
real datasets by introducing the formalism of weighted Riemannian submanifolds.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Manifold-valued data naturally arises in medical imaging.

and increasing order time series models such as infinite-order autoregression,
nonparametric sieve regression and multiple regression with growing dimension.
Examples include the Chow test, Andrews and Ploberger (1994) type exponential
tests, and testing of general linear restrictions of growing rank $p$. Notably,
our tests introduce a new scale correction to the conventional quadratic forms
that are recentered and normalized to account for diverging $p$. This
correction accounts for a high-order long-run variance that emerges as $p$
grows with sample size in time series regression. Furthermore, we propose a
bias correction via a null-imposed bootstrap to control finite sample bias
without sacrificing power unduly. A simulation study stresses the importance of

motion of opening, chewing and swallowing. In order to analyse the dynamics of
the stomatognathic system its morphology and motion has to be digitized, which
is done using static and dynamic multimodal imagery like CBCT and 3D scans data

combines the best of traditional statistical models and neural networks. We
focus on time-series with long-range dependencies, needed for monitoring fine
granularity data (e.g. minutes, seconds, milliseconds), prevalent in
operational use-cases.
  Traditional models, such as auto-regression fitted with least squares
(Classic-AR) can model time-series with a concise and interpretable model. When
dealing with long-range dependencies, Classic-AR models can become intractably
slow to fit for large data. Recently, sequence-to-sequence models, such as
Recurrent Neural Networks, which were originally intended for natural language
processing, have become popular for time-series. However, they can be overly
complex for typical time-series data and lack interpretability.
  A scalable and interpretable model is needed to bridge the statistical and
deep learning-based approaches. As a first step towards this goal, we propose
modelling AR-process dynamics using a feed-forward neural network approach,
termed AR-Net. We show that AR-Net is as interpretable as Classic-AR but also
scales to long-range dependencies.
  Our results lead to three major conclusions: First, AR-Net learns identical
AR-coefficients as Classic-AR, thus being equally interpretable. Second, the
computational complexity with respect to the order of the AR process, is linear
for AR-Net as compared to a quadratic for Classic-AR. This makes it possible to
model long-range dependencies within fine granularity data. Third, by
introducing regularization, AR-Net automatically selects and learns sparse
AR-coefficients. This eliminates the need to know the exact order of the
AR-process and allows to learn sparse weights for a model with long-range
dependencies.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'In this paper we present a new framework for time-series modeling that\ncombines the best of traditional statistical models and neural networks.

Part I: Theory'}","A theory of Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances for stochastic differential
systems is presented. These resonances are defined as the eigenvalues of the
generator (Kolmogorov operator) of a given stochastic system. By relying on the
theory of Markov semigroups, decomposition formulas of correlation functions
and power spectral densities (PSDs) in terms of RP resonances are then derived.
These formulas describe, for a broad class of stochastic differential equations
(SDEs), how the RP resonances characterize the decay of correlations as well as
the signal's oscillatory components manifested by peaks in the PSD.It is then
shown that a notion reduced RP resonances can be rigorously defined, as soon as
the dynamics is partially observed within a reduced state space V . These
reduced resonances are obtained from the spectral elements of reduced Markov
operators acting on functions of the state space V , and can be estimated from
series. They inform us about the spectral elements of some coarse-grained
version of the SDE generator. When the time-lag at which the transitions are
collected from partial observations in V , is either sufficiently small or
large, it is shown that the reduced RP resonances approximate the (weak) RP
resonances of the generator of the conditional expectation in V , i.e. the
optimal reduced system in V obtained by averaging out the contribution of the
unobserved variables. The approach is illustrated on a stochastic slow-fast
system for which it is shown that the reduced RP resonances allow for a good
reconstruction of the correlation functions and PSDs, even when the time-scale
separation is weak.The companions articles, Part II and Part III, deal with
further practical aspects of the theory presented in this contribution. One
important byproduct consists of the diagnosis usefulness of stochastic dynamics
that RP resonances provide. This is illustrated in the case of a stochastic
Hopf bifurcation in Part II. There, it is shown that such a bifurcation has a
clear manifestation in terms of a geometric organization of the RP resonances
along discrete parabolas in the left half plane. Such geometric features formed
by (reduced) RP resonances are extractable from time series and allow thus for
providing an unambiguous ""signature"" of nonlinear oscillations embedded within
a stochastic background. By relying then on the theory of reduced RP resonances

and characterization of such oscillations in a high-dimensional stochastic

complex networks to investigate the time evolutionary behavior of dynamical
system. The authors focus on a simple variant of VG algorithm called horizontal
visibility graph (HVG). The tracking of dynamics and hence, the predictability
of streamflow processes, are carried out by extracting two key pieces of

demonstrate that dynamics transition through potentially chaotic to randomly

Brightness-temperature fluctuations in individual pixels could reach up to a

in the range ~ 55-75 K, i.e., up to ~ 1 % of the averaged brightness

synthetic time series for wind power generation despite their need for accurate

investigate structures and the spectrum of its accretion disc. The light curves
after removal of the ellipsoidal variations caused by the mass-donor star show
a double-wave modulation signalling the presence of two asymmetric light
sources in the accretion disc. Eclipse maps reveal two spiral arms on top of
the disc emission, one at $R_1= 0.28\pm 0.02 \,R_\mathrm{L1}$ and the other at
$R_2= 0.42\pm 0.02 \,R_\mathrm{L1}$ (where $R_\mathrm{L1}$ is the distance from

Many road users suffer
from traffic accidents, as well as their consequences such as delay,
congestion, air pollution, and so on. In this study, we utilize two advanced
deep learning techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent
Units (GRUs), to detect traffic accidents in Chicago. These two techniques are
selected because they are known to perform well with sequential data (i.e.,
time series). The full dataset consists of 241 accident and 6,038 non-accident
cases selected from Chicago expressway, and it includes traffic spatiotemporal
data, weather condition data, and congestion status data. Moreover, because the
dataset is imbalanced (i.e., the dataset contains many more non-accident cases
than accident cases), Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) is

density estimator formulated by the kernel embedding of distributions with
""Mercer-type"" kernels, constructed based on the classical orthogonal
polynomials defined on non-compact domains. While the resulting representation
is analogous to Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), the connection to the
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) theory allows one to establish the
uniform convergence of the estimator and to systematically address a practical
question of identifying the PCE basis for a consistent estimation. We also
provide practical conditions for the well-posedness of not only the estimator
but also of the underlying response statistics. Finally, we provide a
statistical error bound for the density estimation that accounts for the
Monte-Carlo averaging over non-i.i.d time series and the biases due to a finite
basis truncation. This error bound provides a means to understand the
feasibility as well as limitation of the kernel embedding with Mercer-type

TC3 is extended with a structure of options, which comes to the TC3-Options.

assembled for thousands of stars with telescopes operating in space. Such data
have allowed astronomers to measure the physics of stellar interiors via
nonradial oscillations, opening a new avenue to study the stars in the
Universe. Asteroseismology, the interpretation of the characteristics of
oscillation modes in terms of the physical properties of the stellar interior,
brought entirely new insights in how stars rotate and how they build up their
chemistry throughout their evolution. Data-driven space asteroseismology
delivered a drastic increase in the reliability of computer models mimicking
the evolution of stars born with a variety of masses and metallicities. Such
models are critical ingredients for modern physics as a whole, because they are
used throughout various contemporary and multidisciplinary research fields in
space science, including the search for life outside the solar system,
archaeological studies of the Milky Way, and the study of single and binary
supernova progenitors, among which are future gravitational wave sources. The

puts out average independence and positive and significant tail independence

time reliability in urban areas. Adaptive signal control system (ASCS) is the
most advanced traffic signal technology that regulates the signal phasing and
timings considering the patterns in real-time in order to reduce congestion.
Real-time prediction of queue lengths can be used to adjust the phasing and
timings for different movements at an intersection with ASCS. The accuracy of
the prediction varies based on the factors, such as the stochastic nature of
the vehicle arrival rates, time of the day, weather and driver characteristics.
In addition, accurate prediction for multilane, undersaturated and saturated
traffic scenarios is challenging. Thus, the objective of this study is to
develop queue length prediction models for signalized intersections that can be
leveraged by ASCS using four variations of Grey systems: (i) the first order
single variable Grey model (GM(1,1)); (ii) GM(1,1) with Fourier error
corrections; (iii) the Grey Verhulst model (GVM), and (iv) GVM with Fourier
error corrections. The efficacy of the GM is that they facilitate fast
processing; as these models do not require a large amount of data; as would be
needed in artificial intelligence models; and they are able to adapt to
stochastic changes, unlike statistical models. We have conducted a case study
using queue length data from five intersections with ASCS on a calibrated
roadway network in Lexington, South Carolina. GM were compared with linear,
nonlinear time series models, and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network.
Based on our analyses, we found that EGVM reduces the prediction error over
closest competing models (i.e., LSTM and time series models) in predicting
average and maximum queue lengths by 40% and 42%, respectively, in terms of
Root Mean Squared Error, and 51% and 50%, respectively, in terms of Mean
Absolute Error.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Traffic congestion at a signalized intersection greatly reduces the travel\ntime reliability in urban areas.

immunizations as MMR has been declining to worryingly low levels. In 2017, the
Italian Gov't expanded the number of mandatory immunizations introducing
penalties to unvaccinated children's families. During the 2018 general
elections campaign, immunization policy entered the political debate with the
Gov't in charge blaming oppositions for fuelling vaccine scepticism. A new
Gov't established in 2018 temporarily relaxed penalties. Objectives and
Methods. Using a sentiment analysis on tweets posted in Italian during 2018, we
aimed to: (i) characterize the temporal flow of vaccines communication on
Twitter (ii) evaluate the polarity of vaccination opinions and usefulness of
Twitter data to estimate vaccination parameters, and (iii) investigate whether
the contrasting announcements at the highest political level might have
originated disorientation amongst the Italian public. Results. Vaccine-relevant
tweeters interactions peaked in response to main political events. Out of
retained tweets, 70.0% resulted favourable to vaccination, 16.5% unfavourable,
and 13.6% undecided, respectively. The smoothed time series of polarity
proportions exhibit frequent large changes in the favourable proportion,
enhanced by an up and down trend synchronized with the switch between gov't
suggesting evidence of disorientation among the public. Conclusion. The
reported evidence of disorientation documents that critical immunization

given the increasing role of online social media as information source, which
might yield to social pressures eventually harmful for vaccine uptake, and is
worsened by the lack of institutional presence on Twitter, calling for efforts
to contrast misinformation and the ensuing spread of hesitancy.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""Background.

600 stations. Covering large parts of North America and Europe, these stations
represent various climate and catchment characteristics, and thus can
collectively support benchmarking. Five individual forecasting methods and 26
variants of the introduced methodology are applied to each time series. The
application is made in one-step ahead forecasting mode. The individual methods
are the last-observation benchmark, simple exponential smoothing, complex
exponential smoothing, automatic autoregressive fractionally integrated moving
average (ARFIMA) and Facebook's Prophet, while the 26 variants are defined by
all the possible combinations (per two, three, four or five) of the five

the Sun with the aim to characterise the diagnostic potential of brightness
temperatures measured with ALMA on the Sun. The observation covers 48min at a
cadence of 2s targeting a Quiet Sun region at disk-centre. Corresponding time
series of brightness temperature maps are constructed with the first version of
the Solar ALMA Pipeline (SoAP) and compared to simultaneous SDO observations.
The angular resolution of the observations is set by the synthesized beam
(1.4x2.1as). The ALMA maps exhibit network patches, internetwork regions and
also elongated thin features that are connected to large-scale magnetic loops
as confirmed by a comparison with SDO maps. The ALMA Band 3 maps correlate best
with the SDO/AIA 171, 131 and 304 channels in that they exhibit network
features and, although very weak in the ALMA maps, imprints of large-scale
loops. A group of compact magnetic loops is very clearly visible in ALMA Band
3. The brightness temperatures in the loop tops reach values of about
8000-9000K and in extreme moments up to 10 000K. ALMA Band 3 interferometric
observations from early observing cycles already reveal temperature differences
in the solar chromosphere. The weak imprint of magnetic loops and the
correlation with the 171, 131, and 304 SDO channels suggests though that the
radiation mapped in ALMA Band 3 might have contributions from a larger range of
atmospheric heights than previously assumed but the exact formation height of
Band 3 needs to be investigated in more detail. The absolute brightness
temperature scale as set by Total Power measurements remains less certain and
must be improved in the future. Despite these complications and the limited

Experiments on\nmulti-subject datasets demonstrate that SHA method achieves up to 19% better\nperformance for multi-class problems over the state-of-the-art HA algorithms.'}","[{'name': 'Muhammad Yousefnezhad'}, {'name': 'Alessandro Selvitella'}, {'name': 'Liangxiu Han'}, {'name': 'Daoqiang Zhang'}]",{'name': 'Daoqiang Zhang'},Daoqiang Zhang,10.1109/TCDS.2020.2965981,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCDS.2020.2965981', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.02894v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.02894v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'q-bio.NC', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems,

performance and complexity, provides two feasible perspectives. In this thesis,
I address several key questions in some aspects of intelligence, and study the
phase transitions in the two-term tradeoff, using strategies and tools from
physics and information. Firstly, how can we make the learning models more
flexible and efficient, so that agents can learn quickly with fewer examples?
Inspired by how physicists model the world, we introduce a paradigm and an AI
Physicist agent for simultaneously learning many small specialized models
(theories) and the domain they are accurate, which can then be simplified,
unified and stored, facilitating few-shot learning in a continual way.
Secondly, for representation learning, when can we learn a good representation,
and how does learning depend on the structure of the dataset? We approach this
question by studying phase transitions when tuning the tradeoff hyperparameter.
In the information bottleneck, we theoretically show that these phase
transitions are predictable and reveal structure in the relationships between
the data, the model, the learned representation and the loss landscape.
Thirdly, how can agents discover causality from observations? We address part
of this question by introducing an algorithm that combines prediction and
minimizing information from the input, for exploratory causal discovery from
observational time series. Fourthly, to make models more robust to label noise,
we introduce Rank Pruning, a robust algorithm for classification with noisy

additional noise, random walks, rounding errors and/or drifts are increasingly
used for data analysis in fields such as biology, ecology, engineering and
economics where the length of the observed signals can be extremely large.
Performing inference on and/or prediction from these models can be highly
challenging for several reasons: (i) the data may contain outliers that can
adversely affect the estimation procedure; (ii) the computational complexity

generalisation of the well-known univariate OU process to bivariate time
series. This process maps out elliptical stochastic oscillations over time in
the complex plane, which are observed in many applications of coupled bivariate
time series. The appeal of the model is that elliptical oscillations are
generated using one simple first order SDE, whereas alternative models require
more complicated vectorised or higher order SDE representations. The second
useful feature is that parameter estimation can be performed robustly in the
frequency domain using only the modelled and observed power spectral density,
without having to model and compute cross spectra of individual time series

and medical investigations of transient associations. However, the most popular
reference-select strategy, the time-stratified schema, is not a suitable
solution for controlling bias in case-crossover studies. To prove this, we
conducted a time series decomposition for daily ozone (O3) records; scrutinized
the ability of the time-stratified schema on controlling the yearly, monthly
and weekly time trends; and found it failed on controlling the weekly time
trend. Based on this finding, we proposed a new logistic regression approach in
which we did adjustment for the weekly time trend. A comparison between the
traditional model and the proposed method was done by simulation. An empirical
study was conducted to explore potential associations between air pollutants
and AMI hospitalizations. In summary, time-stratified schema provide effective
control on yearly and monthly time trends but not on weekly time trend.
Therefore, the estimation from the traditional logistical regression basically

That is to\nsay, though the absolute information flow from $A$ to $B$ is zero, i.e.,\n$T_{A\\to B}=0$, the total information increase of $B$ is also zero, so the\nnormalized $T_{A\\to B}$, denoted as $\\tau_{A\\to B}$, takes the form of $\\frac 0\n0$. By slightly perturbating the system with some noise, solving a stochastic\ndifferential equation, and letting the perturbation go to zero, it can be shown\nthat $\\tau_{A\\to B}$ approaches 100\\%, just as one would have expected.""}","[{'name': 'X.

as such information is often unknown in advance, or anomalies with different
lengths might co-exist in the data. To address this limitation, previously, a
linear time anomaly detection algorithm based on grammar induction has been
proposed. While the algorithm can find variable-length patterns, it still
requires preselecting values for at least two parameters at the discretization
step. How to choose these parameter values properly is still an open problem.
In this paper, we introduce a grammar-induction-based anomaly detection method
utilizing ensemble learning. Instead of using a particular choice of parameter
values for anomaly detection, the method generates the final result based on a
set of results obtained using different parameter values. We demonstrate that
the proposed ensemble approach can outperform existing grammar-induction-based

models of molecular interactions is a long-standing challenge in systems
biology: low-level chemical reaction network (CRN) models give raise to a
highly-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) which is computationally
demanding and often prohibitive to analyse in practice. A recently proposed
abstraction method uses deep learning to replace this CTMC with a discrete-time
continuous-space process, by training a mixture density deep neural network
with traces sampled at regular time intervals (which can obtained either by
simulating a given CRN or as time-series data from experiment). The major
advantage of such abstraction is that it produces a computational model that is
dramatically cheaper to execute, while preserving the statistical features of
the training data. In general, the abstraction accuracy improves with the
amount of training data. However, depending on a CRN, the overall quality of
the method -- the efficiency gain and abstraction accuracy -- will also depend
on the choice of neural network architecture given by hyper-parameters such as
the layer types and connections between them. As a consequence, in practice,
the modeller would have to take care of finding the suitable architecture
manually, for each given CRN, through a tedious and time-consuming
trial-and-error cycle. In this paper, we propose to further automatise deep
abstractions for stochastic CRNs, through learning the optimal neural network
architecture along with learning the transition kernel of the abstract process.
Automated search of the architecture makes the method applicable directly to

series modeling and forecasting, it has not been fully explored on the design
of the neural network architecture as well as the tuning of the
hyper-parameters. Inspired by the iterative construction strategy for building
a random multilayer perceptron, we propose a novel Error-feedback Stochastic
Configuration (ESC) strategy to construct a random Convolutional Neural Network
(ESC-CNN) for time series forecasting task, which builds the network
architecture adaptively. The ESC strategy suggests that random filters and
neurons of the error-feedback fully connected layer are incrementally added in
a manner that they can steadily compensate the prediction error during the
construction process, and a filter selection strategy is introduced to secure
that ESC-CNN holds the universal approximation property, providing helpful
information at each iterative process for the prediction. The performance of
ESC-CNN is justified on its prediction accuracy for one-step-ahead and
multi-step-ahead forecasting tasks. Comprehensive experiments on a synthetic
dataset and two real-world datasets show that the proposed ESC-CNN not only
outperforms the state-of-art random neural networks, but also exhibits strong

ecological time series. These hierarchical models are commonly used to model
population dynamics, animal movement, and capture-recapture data, and are now
increasingly being used to model other ecological processes. SSMs are popular
because they are flexible and they model the natural variation in ecological
processes separately from observation error. Their flexibility allows
ecologists to model continuous, count, binary, and categorical data with linear
or nonlinear processes that evolve in discrete or continuous time. Modeling the
two sources of stochasticity separately allows researchers to differentiate
between biological variation (e.g., in birth processes) and imprecision in the
sampling methodology, and generally provides better estimates of the ecological
quantities of interest than if only one source of stochasticity is directly

have been proposed. However, the variety and complexity of these procedures can

unprecedented opportunities to not only inform health and wellness states of
individuals, but also assess and infer personal attributes, including
demographic and personality attributes. However, the data captured from
wearables, such as heart rate or number of steps, present two key challenges:
1) the time series is often of variable-length and incomplete due to different
data collection periods (e.g., wearing behavior varies by person); and 2)
inter-individual variability to external factors like stress and environment.
This paper addresses these challenges and brings us closer to the potential of
personalized insights about an individual, taking the leap from quantified self
to qualified self. Specifically, HeartSpace proposed in this paper encodes time
series data with variable-length and missing values via the integration of a

Furthermore, considering cases\nwhere computational realization of the knowledge-based component does not\nresolve subgrid-scale processes, our scheme is able to use training data to\nincorporate the effect of the unresolved short-scale dynamics upon the resolved\nlonger-scale dynamics (""subgrid-scale closure"").'}","[{'name': 'Alexander Wikner'}, {'name': 'Jaideep Pathak'}, {'name': 'Brian Hunt'}, {'name': 'Michelle Girvan'}, {'name': 'Troy Arcomano'}, {'name': 'Istvan Szunyogh'}, {'name': 'Andrew Pomerance'}, {'name': 'Edward Ott'}]",{'name': 'Edward Ott'},Edward Ott,10.1063/5.0005541,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/5.0005541', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05514v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05514v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'nlin.CD', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'physics.ao-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'physics.comp-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]","45 pages, 15 figures",

sunspots in the solar chromosphere that occurs along dark, elongated
superpenumbral fibrils extending from about the outer edge of the moat cell to
the sunspot. The IEF channels exhibit brightenings in the penumbra, where the
supersonic IEF descends to the photosphere causing shock fronts with localized
heating. We used an 1-hr time-series of spectroscopic observations of the
chromospheric spectral lines of CaIIIR at 854nm and H$\alpha$ at 656nm taken
with IBIS at the DST to investigate the temporal evolution of IEF channels.
Complementary information on the photospheric magnetic field was obtained from

are long-lived (10-60min) and only show minor changes in position and flow

drastically reduced when the raw voltage data are digitally filtered through an
arbitrarily large number $n$ of orthornormal bandpass profiles (eigen-filters)
sharing the same intensity bandwidth, and the resulting intensity series are
co-added. Specifically, the relative noise variance of the summed series at the
resolution of one coherence time or less, goes down with increasing $n$ as
$1/n$, although (consistent with the radiometer equation) the advantage
gradually disappears when the series is bin averaged to lower resolution. Thus
the algorithm is designed to enhance the sensitivity of detecting transients
that are smoothed out by time averaging and too faint to be visible in the
noisy unaveraged time series, as demonstrated by the simulation of a weak
embedded time varying signal of either a periodic nature or a fast and
unrepeated pulse. The algorithm is then applied to a 10 minute observation of
the pulsar PSR 1937+21 by the VLA, where the theoretical predictions were

source in the radial velocity (RV) data. This noise impedes the detection of
small exoplanets. Moreover, the unknown statistics (amplitude, distribution)
related to this noise make it difficult to estimate the false alarm probability
(FAP) for exoplanet detection tests. In this paper, we investigate the
possibility of using 3D magneto-hydrodynamical simulations (MHD) of stellar
convection to design detection methods that can provide both a reliable

simulations in producing solar RV by comparing them with the observed disk
integrated velocities taken by the GOLF instrument on board the SOHO
spacecraft. We presented a new detection method based on periodograms
standardized by these simulated time series, applying several detection tests
to these standarized periodograms. The power spectral density of the 3D
synthetic convective noise is consistent with solar RV observations for short
periods. For regularly sampled observations, the analytic expressions of FAP
derived for several statistical tests applied to the periodogram standardized
by 3D simulation noise are accurate. The adaptive tests considered in this work
(Higher-Criticism, Berk-Jones), which are new in the exoplanet field, may offer
better detection performance than classical tests (based on the highest
periodogram value) in the case of multi-planetary systems and planets with
eccentric orbits. 3D MHD simulations are now mature enough to produce reliable
synthetic time series of the convective noise affecting RV data. These series
can be used to access to the statistics of this noise and derive accurate FAP
of tests that are a critical element in the detection of exoplanets down to the

For regularly sampled observations, the analytic expressions of FAP\nderived for several statistical tests applied to the periodogram standardized\nby 3D simulation noise are accurate. The adaptive tests considered in this work\n(Higher-Criticism, Berk-Jones), which are new in the exoplanet field, may offer\nbetter detection performance than classical tests (based on the highest\nperiodogram value) in the case of multi-planetary systems and planets with\neccentric orbits. 3D MHD simulations are now mature enough to produce reliable\nsynthetic time series of the convective noise affecting RV data. These series\ncan be used to access to the statistics of this noise and derive accurate FAP\nof tests that are a critical element in the detection of exoplanets down to the\ncm/s level.'}","[{'name': 'S.

convolutional neural network for time series data. The seasonal-trend
decomposition can effectively handle complicated patterns in time series, and
meanwhile significantly simplifies the architecture of the neural network,
which is an encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections. This
architecture can effectively capture the multi-scale information from time
series, which is very useful in anomaly detection. Due to the limited labeled
data in time series anomaly detection, we systematically investigate data
augmentation methods in both time and frequency domains. We also introduce
label-based weight and value-based weight in the loss function by utilizing the
unbalanced nature of the time series anomaly detection problem. Compared with
the widely used forecasting-based anomaly detection algorithms,
decomposition-based algorithms, traditional statistical algorithms, as well as

series that can be deduced from a visibility mapping. This visibility mapping
associates to each point $(t,x(t))$ of the time series to its horizontal
visibility basin, i.e. the number of points of the time series that can be seen
horizontally from each respective point. We apply this study to the class of
unimodal maps that give rise to equivalent bifurcation diagrams. We use the
classical logistic map to illustrate the main results of this paper: there are
visibility patterns in each cascade of the bifurcation diagram, converging at
the onset of chaos.
  The visibility pattern of a periodic time series is generated from elementary
blocks of visibility in a recursive way. This rule of recurrence applies to all
periodic-doubling cascades. Within a particular window, as the growth parameter
$r$ varies and each period doubles, these blocks are recurrently embedded
forming the visibility pattern for each period. In the limit, at the onset of
chaos, an infinite pattern of visibility appears containing all visibility
patterns of the periodic time series of the cascade.
  We have seen that these visibility patterns have specific properties: (i) the
size of the elementary blocks depends on the period of the time series, (ii)
certain time series sharing the same periodicity can have different elementary
blocks and, therefore, different visibility patterns, (iii) since the 2-period
and 3-period windows are unique, the respective elementary blocks, $ \{2\} $

the heliosphere that travel from the Sun into the interplanetary medium. The

configuration, by the processes involved during its eruption from the Sun, and
by the dynamical evolution during its interaction with the ambient solar wind.
One of the most important properties of the magnetic structure inside MCs is
the twist of the field lines forming the FR (the number of turns per unit
length). The detailed internal distribution of twist is under debate mainly
because the magnetic field (B) in MCs is observed only along the spacecraft
trajectory, and thus it is necessary to complete observations with theoretical
assumptions. Estimating the twist from the study of a single event is difficult
because the field fluctuations significantly increase the noise of the observed
B time series and thus the bias of the deduced twist. The superposed epoch

of their common features, and removing the peculiarity of individual cases. We
apply a superposed epoch technique to analyse the magnetic components in the
local FR frame of a significant sample of moderately asymmetric MCs observed at
1 au. From the superposed profile of B components in the FR frame, we determine
the typical twist distribution in MCs. The twist is nearly uniform in the FR

irregularities such as chaotic, non-linear, and stochastic trends. The key
features of the approach include (1) it enforces mean reversion, (2) it
provides a means to model both short and long-term dynamics, (3) it is able to

following crucial questions for COVID-19: (Q1) Is it possible to contain
COVID-19? (Q2) When will be the peak and the end of the epidemic? (Q3) How do
the asymptomatic infections affect the spread of disease? (Q4) What is the
ratio of the population that needs to be infected to achieve herd immunity?
(Q5) How effective are the social distancing approaches? (Q6) What is the ratio
of the population infected in the long run? For (Q1) and (Q2), we propose a
time-dependent susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that tracks 2 time
series: (i) the transmission rate at time t and (ii) the recovering rate at
time t. Such an approach is more adaptive than traditional static SIR models
and more robust than direct estimation methods. Using the data provided by
China, we show that the one-day prediction errors for the numbers of confirmed
cases are almost in 3%, and the total number of confirmed cases is precisely
predicted. Also, the turning point, defined as the day that the transmission
rate is less than the recovering rate can be accurately predicted. After that
day, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is less than 1. For (Q3), we extend
our SIR model by considering 2 types of infected persons: detectable and
undetectable infected persons. Whether there is an outbreak in such a model is
characterized by the spectral radius of a 2 by 2 matrix that is closely related
to $R_0$. For (Q4), we show that herd immunity can be achieved after at least

determined from historical households consumption time series. Thus, we aim to
forecast the electricity consumption time series at several levels of
households aggregation. These time series are linked through some summation
constraints which induce a hierarchy. Our approach consists in three steps:
feature generation, aggregation and projection. Firstly (feature generation
step), we build, for each considering group for households, a benchmark
forecast (called features), using random forests or generalized additive
models. Secondly (aggregation step), aggregation algorithms, run in parallel,
aggregate these forecasts and provide new predictions. Finally (projection
step), we use the summation constraints induced by the time series underlying
hierarchy to re-conciliate the forecasts by projecting them in a well-chosen
linear subspace. We provide some theoretical guaranties on the average
prediction error of this methodology, through the minimization of a quantity
called regret. We also test our approach on households power consumption data
collected in Great Britain by multiple energy providers in the Energy Demand
Research Project context. We build and compare various population segmentations

heating rate due to free magnetic energy dissipation. Here we present a first
test of a new model developed to determine if the times of increases in the
resistive heating rate in active region (AR) photospheres are correlated with
the subsequent occurrence of M and X flares in the corona. A data driven, 3 D,
non-force-free magnetohydrodynamic model restricted to the near-photospheric
region is used to compute time series of the complete current density and the
resistive heating rate per unit volume $(Q(t))$ in each pixel in neutral line
regions (NLRs) of 14 ARs. The model is driven by time series of the magnetic
field ${\bf B}$ measured by the Helioseismic & Magnetic Imager on the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite. Spurious Doppler periods due to SDO
orbital motion are filtered out of the time series for ${\bf B}$ in every AR
pixel. For each AR, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the values of
the NLR area integral $Q_i(t)$ of $Q(t)$ is found to be a scale invariant power
law distribution essentially identical to the observed CDF for the total energy
released in coronal flares. This suggests that coronal flares and the
photospheric $Q_i$ are correlated, and powered by the same process. The model
predicts spikes in $Q_i$ with values orders of magnitude above background
values. These spikes are driven by spikes in the non-force free component of
the current density. The times of these spikes are plausibly correlated with
times of subsequent M or X flares a few hours to a few days later. The spikes
occur on granulation scales, and may be signatures of heating in horizontal
current sheets. It is also found that the times of relatively large values of
the rate of change of the NLR unsigned magnetic flux are also plausibly

We illustrate the results for migrants from Mexico, India and\nGermany, and show that the model outperforms alternatives that rely solely on\neither social media or survey data.""}","[{'name': 'Monica Alexander'}, {'name': 'Kivan Polimis'}, {'name': 'Emilio Zagheni'}]",{'name': 'Emilio Zagheni'},Emilio Zagheni,10.1007/s11113-020-09599-3,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11113-020-09599-3', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02895v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02895v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'stat.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'stat.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,

understanding of natural and artificial systems. Unfortunately, the hypothesis

This is due to the autocorrelation present in the analysed time series -- a
property that is ubiquitous across diverse applications, from brain dynamics to
climate change. Here we show that, for limited data, this issue cannot be
mediated by fitting a time-series model alone (e.g., in Granger causality or

demonstrate that the commonly used $F$- and $\chi^2$-tests can induce
significant false-positive rates of up to $100\%$ for both measures, with and

spectral observations consisted in cross-correlating the spectra with a binary
mask, that is, a simple stellar template that contains information on the
position and strength of stellar absorption lines. The cross-correlation
function (CCF) profiles also provide several indicators of stellar activity. We
present a methodology to first build weighted binary masks and, second, to
compute the CCF of spectral observations with these masks from which we derive
radial velocities and activity indicators. These methods are implemented in a
python code that is publicly available. To build the masks, we selected a large
number of sharp absorption lines based on the profile of the minima present in
high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) spectrum templates built from observations of
reference stars. We computed the CCFs of observed spectra and derived RVs and
the following three standard activity indicators: full-width-at-half-maximum as
well as contrast and bisector inverse slope.We applied our methodology to
CARMENES high-resolution spectra and obtain RV and activity indicator time
series of more than 300 M dwarf stars observed for the main CARMENES survey.
Compared with the standard CARMENES template matching pipeline, in general we
obtain more precise RVs in the cases where the template used in the standard
pipeline did not have enough S/N. We also show the behaviour of the three

electrode design and age, as well as water saturation, pore water chemistry,

classification, the proliferation of learning architectures applied to diverse
datasets has thus far hampered a direct intercomparison of different
approaches. Here we perform the first comprehensive study of variants of
NN-based learning and inference for astronomical time-series, aiming to provide
the community with an overview on relative performance and, hopefully, a set of
best-in-class choices for practical implementations. In both supervised and
self-supervised contexts, we study the effects of different
time-series-compatible layer choices, namely the dilated temporal convolutional
neural network (dTCNs), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) NNs, Gated Recurrent
Units (GRUs) and temporal convolutional NNs (tCNNs). We also study the efficacy
and performance of encoder-decoder (i.e., autoencoder) networks compared to
direct classification networks, different pathways to include auxiliary
(non-time-series) metadata, and different approaches to incorporate
multi-passband data (i.e., multiple time-series per source).
Performance---applied to a sample of 17,604 variable stars from the MACHO
survey across 10 imbalanced classes---is measured in training convergence time,
classification accuracy, reconstruction error, and generated latent variables.
We find that networks with Recurrent NN (RNNs) generally outperform dTCNs and,
in many scenarios, yield to similar accuracy as tCNNs. In learning time and
memory requirements, convolution-based layers are more performant. We conclude
by discussing the advantages and limitations of deep architectures for variable

accounted for 46% of all CO2 emissions globally, which shows a large potential

enable intelligent scheduling of flexible electricity consumption to minimize
the resulting CO2 emissions. Two proposed time series decomposition methods are
developed for short-term forecasting of the CO2 emissions of electricity. These
are in turn bench-marked against a set of state-of-the-art models. The result
is a new forecasting method with a 48-hour horizon targeted the day-ahead
electricity market. Forecasting benchmarks for France show that the new method
has a mean absolute percentage error that is 25% lower than the best performing
state-of-the-art model. Further, application of the forecast for scheduling
flexible electricity consumption is studied for five European countries.
Scheduling a flexible block of 4 hours of electricity consumption in a 24 hour
interval can on average reduce the resulting CO2 emissions by 25% in France,
17% in Germany, 69% in Norway, 20% in Denmark, and just 3% in Poland when

time series (TS) data. Recently, several approaches using deep neural networks
(DNNs) such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been introduced for TS
forecasting and have shown promising results. However, the applicability of
these approaches is being questioned for TS settings where there is a lack of
quality training data and where the TS to forecast exhibit complex behaviors.
Examples of such settings include financial TS forecasting, where producing
accurate and consistent long-term forecasts is notoriously difficult. In this
work, we investigate whether DNN-based models can be used to forecast these TS
conjointly by learning a joint representation of the series instead of
computing the forecast from the raw time-series representations. To this end,
we make use of the dynamic factor graph (DFG) to build a multivariate
autoregressive model. We investigate a common limitation of RNNs that rely on
the DFG framework and propose a novel variable-length attention-based mechanism
(ACTM) to address it. With ACTM, it is possible to vary the autoregressive
order of a TS model over time and model a larger set of probability
distributions than with previous approaches. Using this mechanism, we propose a
self-supervised DNN architecture for multivariate TS forecasting that learns
and takes advantage of the relationships between them. We test our model on two
datasets covering 19 years of investment fund activities. Our experimental
results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms typical
DNN-based and statistical models at forecasting the 21-day price trajectory. We
point out how improving forecasting accuracy and knowing which forecaster to
use can improve the excess return of autonomous trading strategies.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Optimal decision-making in social settings is often based on forecasts from\ntime series (TS) data.

In this\nwork, we investigate whether DNN-based models can be used to forecast these TS\nconjointly by learning a joint representation of the series instead of\ncomputing the forecast from the raw time-series representations. To this end,\nwe make use of the dynamic factor graph (DFG) to build a multivariate\nautoregressive model. We investigate a common limitation of RNNs that rely on\nthe DFG framework and propose a novel variable-length attention-based mechanism\n(ACTM) to address it. With ACTM, it is possible to vary the autoregressive\norder of a TS model over time and model a larger set of probability\ndistributions than with previous approaches. Using this mechanism, we propose a\nself-supervised DNN architecture for multivariate TS forecasting that learns\nand takes advantage of the relationships between them. We test our model on two\ndatasets covering 19 years of investment fund activities. Our experimental\nresults show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms typical\nDNN-based and statistical models at forecasting the 21-day price trajectory. We\npoint out how improving forecasting accuracy and knowing which forecaster to\nuse can improve the excess return of autonomous trading strategies.'}","[{'name': 'Philippe Chatigny'}, {'name': 'Jean-Marc Patenaude'}, {'name': 'Shengrui Wang'}]",{'name': 'Shengrui Wang'},Shengrui Wang,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12194v3', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12194v3', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,

model degradation, online learning methods incrementally learn from new data
samples arriving over time, and accommodate eventual changes along the data

more challenging, even though the geometries of vector spaces and conceptual
spaces are clearly relevant for information retrieval and semantics. In this
paper, we examine two different methods of extraction of topological features
from text, using as the underlying representations of words the two most
popular methods, namely word embeddings and TF-IDF vectors. To extract
topological features from the word embedding space, we interpret the embedding
of a text document as high dimensional time series, and we analyze the topology
of the underlying graph where the vertices correspond to different embedding
dimensions. For topological data analysis with the TF-IDF representations, we
analyze the topology of the graph whose vertices come from the TF-IDF vectors
of different blocks in the textual document. In both cases, we apply
homological persistence to reveal the geometric structures under different
distance resolutions. Our results show that these topological features carry
some exclusive information that is not captured by conventional text mining
methods. In our experiments we observe adding topological features to the
conventional features in ensemble models improves the classification results
(up to 5\%). On the other hand, as expected, topological features by themselves
may be not sufficient for effective classification. It is an open problem to
see whether TDA features from word embeddings might be sufficient, as they seem

solutions to real-world challenges including forecasting epidemics and planning
transportation. These advancements were facilitated by computational tools
enabling the analysis of large-scale data-sets of digital traces. One of the
challenges when pre-processing spatial trajectories is the so-called stop
location detection, that entails the reduction of raw time series to sequences
of destinations where an individual was stationary. The most widely adopted
solution to this problem was proposed by Hariharan and Toyama (2004) and
involves filtering out non-stationary measurements, then applying agglomerative
clustering on the stationary points. This state-of-the-art solution, however,
suffers of two limitations: (i) frequently visited places located very close
(such as adjacent buildings) are likely to be merged into a unique location,
due to inherent measurement noise, (ii) traces for multiple users can not be
analysed simultaneously, thus the definition of destination is not shared
across users. In this paper, we describe the Infostop algorithm that overcomes
the limitations of the state-of-the-art solution by leveraging the flow-based
network community detection algorithm Infomap. We test Infostop for a
population of $\sim 1000$ individuals with highly overlapping mobility. We show
that the size of locations detected by Infostop saturates for increasing number
of users and that time complexity grows slower than for previous solutions. We
demonstrate that Infostop can be used to easily infer social meetings. Finally,

operation of urban metro systems. Previous studies mainly model passenger flow
as time series by aggregating individual trips and then perform forecasting
based on the values in the past several steps. However, this approach
essentially overlooks the fact that passenger flow consists of trips from each
individual traveler. For example, a traveler's work trip in the morning can
help predict his/her home trip in the evening, while this causal structure
cannot be explicitly encoded in standard time series models. In this paper, we
propose a new forecasting framework for boarding flow by incorporating the
generative mechanism into standard time series models and leveraging the strong
regularity rooted in travel behavior. In doing so, we introduce returning flow
from previous alighting trips as a new covariate, which captures the causal
structure and long-range dependencies in passenger flow data based on travel
behavior. We develop the return probability parallelogram (RPP) to summarize
the causal relationships and estimate the return flow. The proposed framework
is evaluated using real-world passenger flow data, and the results confirm that
the returning flow -- a single covariate -- can substantially and consistently
improve various forecasting tasks, including one-step ahead forecasting,
multi-step ahead forecasting, and forecasting under special events. And the
proposed method is more effective for business-type stations with most
passengers come and return within the same day. This study can be extended to
other modes of transport, and it also sheds new light on general demand time
series forecasting problems, in which causal structure and long-range
dependencies are generated by the user behavior.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""Accurate forecasting of passenger flow (i.e., ridership) is critical to the\noperation of urban metro systems.

selecting relevant stations in the hydrometric network as reference (donor)

transforms fully connected streamflow stations in the hydrometric network into

several critical shortcomings. Specifically, RNNs generalize poorly over very
long sequences, which limits their applicability to many important temporal
processing and time series forecasting problems. For example, RNNs struggle in
recognizing complex context free languages (CFLs), never reaching 100% accuracy
on training. One way to address these shortcomings is to couple an RNN with an
external, differentiable memory structure, such as a stack. However,
differentiable memories in prior work have neither been extensively studied on
CFLs nor tested on sequences longer than those seen in training. The few

reconstruction in dynamical systems that operates on spaces of probability
measures induced by observables of the system rather than directly in the
original data space of the observables themselves as in more conventional
methods. Our approach is based on the fact that orbits of a dynamical system
induce probability measures over the measurable space defined by (partial)
observations of the system. We equip the space of these probability measures
with a divergence, i.e., a distance between probability distributions, and use
this divergence to define a kernel integral operator. The eigenfunctions of
this operator create an orthonormal basis of functions that capture different
timescales of the dynamical system. One of our main results shows that the
evolution of the moments of the dynamics-dependent probability measures can be
related to a time-averaging operator on the original dynamical system. Using
this result, we show that the moments can be expanded in the eigenfunction
basis, thus opening up the avenue for nonparametric forecasting of the moments.
If the collection of probability measures is itself a manifold, we can in
addition equip the statistical manifold with the Riemannian metric and use
techniques from information geometry. We present applications to ergodic
dynamical systems on the 2-torus and the Lorenz 63 system, and show on a
real-world example that a small number of eigenvectors is sufficient to
reconstruct the moments (here the first four moments) of an atmospheric time
series, i.e., the realtime multivariate Madden-Julian oscillation index.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We propose a dimension reduction framework for feature extraction and moment\nreconstruction in dynamical systems that operates on spaces of probability\nmeasures induced by observables of the system rather than directly in the\noriginal data space of the observables themselves as in more conventional\nmethods.

researchers in the last few years. One main challenge in TSC is the diversity
of domains where time series data come from. Thus, there is no ""one model that
fits all"" in TSC. Some algorithms are very accurate in classifying a specific
type of time series when the whole series is considered, while some only target
the existence/non-existence of specific patterns/shapelets. Yet other
techniques focus on the frequency of occurrences of discriminating
patterns/features. This paper presents a new classification technique that
addresses the inherent diversity problem in TSC using a nature-inspired method.
The technique is stimulated by how flies look at the world through ""compound
eyes"" that are made up of thousands of lenses, called ommatidia. Each
ommatidium is an eye with its own lens, and thousands of them together create a
broad field of vision. The developed technique similarly uses different lenses
and representations to look at the time series, and then combines them for
broader visibility. These lenses have been created through
hyper-parameterisation of symbolic representations (Piecewise Aggregate and
Fourier approximations). The algorithm builds a random forest for each lens,
then performs soft dynamic voting for classifying new instances using the most
confident eyes, i.e, forests. We evaluate the new technique, coined Co-eye,
using the recently released extended version of UCR archive, containing more
than 100 datasets across a wide range of domains. The results show the benefits
of bringing together different perspectives reflecting on the accuracy and

from other physiologically induced T2* changes, using sensors that provide a
ground-truth with respect to cardiac, respiratory, and head movement dynamics.
However, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) time-series dynamics are
confounded by scanner artifacts, in complex ways that can vary not only between
scanners but even, for the same scanner, between sessions. The lack of
equivalent ground truth has thus far stymied the development of reliable
methods for identification and removal of scanner-induced noise. To address
this problem, we first designed and built a phantom capable of providing
dynamic signals equivalent to that of the resting-state brain. Using the
dynamic phantom, we quantified voxel-wise noise by comparing the ground-truth
time-series with its measured fMRI data. We derived the following data-quality
metrics: Standardized Signal-to-Noise Ratio (ST-SNR) and Dynamic Fidelity that
can be directly compared across scanners. Dynamic phantom data acquired from
four scanners showed scanner-instability multiplicative noise contributions of
about 6-18% of the total noise. We further measured strong non-linearity in the
fMRI response for all scanners, ranging between 8-19% of total voxels. To
correct scanner distortion of fMRI time-series dynamics at a single-subject
level, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on paired sets of
measured vs. ground-truth data. Tests on dynamic phantom time-series showed a
4- to 7-fold increase in ST-SNR and about 40-70% increase in Dynamic Fidelity

the span of transit timing observations to 28 years in order to probe the rate

in line with conclusions drawn from studies of the population of hot Jupiters,

chaotic system is compressibile, but a generic initial condition for it is not,
making the time series generated by chaotic systems incompressible in general.

can be a powerful tool for identifying transport mechanisms and predicting
macroscopic properties. We use two different stochastic time series models,
parameterized from long molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories of a
cross-linked HII phase lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membrane, in order to
predict solute mean squared displacements (MSDs) and solute flux, and thus
solute selectivity, in macroscopic length pores. First, using anomalous
diffusion theory, we show how solute dynamics can be modeled as a fractional
diffusion process subordinate to a continuous time random walk. From the MD
simulations, we parameterize the distribution of dwell times, hop lengths
between dwells and correlation between hops. We explore two variations of the
anomalous diffusion modeling approach. The first applies a single set of
parameters to the solute displacements and the second applies two sets of
parameters based on the solute's radial distance from the closest pore center.
Next, we generalize Markov state models, treating the configurational states of
the system as a Markov process where each state has distinct transport
properties. For each state and transition between states, we parameterize the
distribution and temporal correlation structure of positional fluctuations as a
means of characterization and to allow us to predict solute MSDs. Qualitative
differences between MD and Markov state dependent model-generated trajectories
may limit its usefulness. Finally, we demonstrate how one can use these models
to estimate flux of a solute across a macroscopic-length pore and, based on
those quantities, the membrane's selectivity towards each solute. This work
helps to connect microscopic chemically-dependent solute motions that do not
follow simple diffusive behavior with macroscopic membrane performance.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""Mathematically modeling complex transport phenomena at the molecular level\ncan be a powerful tool for identifying transport mechanisms and predicting\nmacroscopic properties.

principles, may be viewed as known, it is often too expensive to numerically
simulate all the interactions they describe. Therefore researchers often seek
simpler descriptions that describe complex phenomena without numerically
resolving all the interacting components. Stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) arise naturally as models in this context. The growth in data
acquisition, both through experiment and through simulations, provides an
opportunity for the systematic derivation of SDE models in many disciplines.
However, inconsistencies between SDEs and real data at short time scales often
cause problems, when standard statistical methodology is applied to parameter
estimation. The incompatibility between SDEs and real data can be addressed by
deriving sufficient statistics from the time-series data and learning
parameters of SDEs based on these. Following this approach, we formulate the
fitting of SDEs to sufficient statistics from real data as an inverse problem
and demonstrate that this inverse problem can be solved by using ensemble
Kalman inversion (EKI). Furthermore, we create a framework for non-parametric
learning of drift and diffusion terms by introducing hierarchical, refinable
parameterizations of unknown functions, using Gaussian process regression. We
demonstrate the proposed methodology for the fitting of SDE models, first in a
simulation study with a noisy Lorenz '63 model, and then in other applications,
including dimension reduction in deterministic chaotic systems arising in the
atmospheric sciences, large-scale pattern modeling in climate dynamics, and
simplified models for key observables arising in molecular dynamics. The

importance that the broader scientific community is currently facing. One of
the main sources of difficulty is that a very limited amount of daily COVID-19
case data is available, and with few exceptions, the majority of countries are
currently in the ""exponential spread stage,"" and thus there is scarce
information available which would enable one to predict the phase transition
between spread and containment.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach to predicting the spread of
COVID-19 based on dictionary learning and online nonnegative matrix
factorization (online NMF). The key idea is to learn dictionary patterns of
short evolution instances of the new daily cases in multiple countries at the

as a geometric random walk combined with jumps modelled by separate, discrete
distributions associated with positive (and negative) bubbles. The key
ingredient of the model is to assume that the sizes of the jumps are
proportional to the bubble size. Thus, the jumps tend to efficiently bring back
excess bubble prices close to a normal or fundamental value (efficient
crashes). This is different from existing processes studied that assume jumps
that are independent of the mispricing. The present model is simplified
compared to Kreuser and Sornette (2018) in that we ignore the possibility of a
change of the probability of a crash as the price accelerates above the normal
price. We study the behaviour of investment strategies that maximize the
expected log of wealth (Kelly criterion) for the risky asset and a risk-free
asset. We show that the method behaves similarly to Kelly on Geometric Brownian
Motion in that it outperforms other methods in the long-term and it beats
classical Kelly. As a primary source of outperformance, we determine knowledge
about the presence of crashes, but interestingly find that knowledge of only
the size, and not the time of occurrence, already provides a significant and

(SWAP) imager onboard the Project for Onboard Autonomy 2 (PROBA2) mission to
study the evolution of large-scale EUV structures in the solar corona observed
throughout Solar Cycle 24 (from 2010 to 2019). We discuss the evolution of the
on-disk coronal features and at different heights above the solar surface based
on EUV intensity changes. We also look at the evolution of the corona in
equatorial and polar regions and compare them at different phases of the solar
cycle, as well as with sunspot number evolution and with the PROBA2/Lyman-Alpha
Radiometer (LYRA) signal. The main results are as follows: The three time
series (SWAP on-disk average brightness, sunspot number and LYRA irradiance)
are very well correlated, with correlation coefficients around 0.9. The average
rotation rate of bright features at latitudes of +15, 0, and -15 degrees was
around 15 degree/day throughout the period studied. A secondary peak in EUV
averaged intensity at the Poles was observed on the descending phase of SC24.
These peaks (at North and South poles respectively) seem to be associated with
the start of the development of the (polar) coronal holes. Large-scale off-limb
structures were visible from around March 2010 to around March 2016, meaning

scales strongly impacts radial velocities. This variability is seen as
oscillations, granulation, supergranulation, and meridional flows. The effect
of this latter process is poorly known but could affect exoplanet
detectability. We aim to quantify its amplitude when integrated over the disc
and its temporal variability, first for the Sun, seen with different
inclinations, and then for other solar-type stars. We used long time series of
solar latitudinal meridional circulation to reconstruct its integrated
contribution. We then used scaling laws from HD simulations relating the
amplitude of the meridional flow variability with stellar mass and rotation
rate to estimate the typical amplitude expected for other solar-type stars. We
find typical rms of the order of 0.5-0.7 m/s (edge-on) and 1.2-1.7 m/s
(pole-on) for the Sun, with a minimal jitter for an inclination of 45-55 deg.
This is significant compared to other stellar activity contributions and is
much larger than the radial-velocity signal of the Earth. The variability is
strongly related to the activity cycle. Extension to other solar-type stars
shows that the variability due to meridional flows is dominated by the
amplitude of the cycle of those stars. The meridional flow contribution
sometimes represents a high fraction of the convective blueshift inhibition
signal, especially for quiet, low-mass stars. Our study shows that these
meridional flows could be critical for exoplanet detection. Low inclinations
are more impacted than edge-on configurations, but these latter still exhibit
significant variability. Meridional flows also degrade the correlation between
radial velocities due to convective blueshift inhibition and chromospheric
activity indicators. This will make the correction from this signal challenging
for stars with no multi-cellular patterns.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Stellar variability due to magnetic activity and flows at different spatial\nscales strongly impacts radial velocities.

scientific and industrial fields, especially when the properties of anomalies
are unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new anomaly concept called ""unicorn""
or unique event and present a new, model-free, unsupervised detection algorithm
to detect unicorns. The key component of the new algorithm is the Temporal
Outlier Factor (TOF) to measure the uniqueness of events in continuous data
sets from dynamic systems. The concept of unique events differs significantly
from traditional outliers in many aspects: while repetitive outliers are no
longer unique events, a unique event is not necessarily an outlier; it does not
necessarily fall out from the distribution of normal activity. The performance
of our algorithm was examined in recognizing unique events on different types
of simulated data sets with anomalies and it was compared with the Local
Outlier Factor (LOF) and discord discovery algorithms. TOF had superior
performance compared to LOF and discord algorithms even in recognizing
traditional outliers and it also recognized unique events that those did not.
The benefits of the unicorn concept and the new detection method were
illustrated by example data sets from very different scientific fields. Our
algorithm successfully recognized unique events in those cases where they were

that are affected by COVID-19 from March 01, 2020 to April 17, 2020. We study
the data in the framework of time series network data. The networks are defined
by using the geodesic distances of the districts or cities specified by the
latitude and longitude coordinates. We particularly restrict our analysis to
all but districts in the north-eastern part of India. Unlike recent studies on
the projection of the number of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the near
future, in this note, the emphasis is on understanding the dynamics of the
spread of the virus across the districts of India. We perform spectral and
structural analysis of the model networks by considering several measures,
notably the spectral radius, the algebraic connectivity, the average clustering
coefficient, the average path length and the structure of the communities.
Furthermore, we study the overall expansion properties given by the number of
districts or cities before and after lockdown. These studies show that lockdown
has a significant impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in districts or cities
over long distances. However, this impact is only observed after approximately
two weeks of lockdown. We speculate that this happened due to the insufficient

biological growth modeling have the potential to provide useful information on
the development and severity of ongoing epidemics since they can be employed as
tools for carrying out projections on the size of the affected population,
timing of turning points, as well as best- and worst-case scenarios.
Nevertheless, they commonly exhibit considerable sensitivity to some input
parameters' variance which results in large fluctuations in the generated
projections, thus rendering predictions difficult and even risky. In this work
we examine a novel meta-projections-based approach which allows us to evaluate
the model's current trends and assess whether generated projections are at a

systems showed evidence of a small number of giant planets at relatively large
separation beyond typically 20 au where those surveys are the most sensitive.
Access to smaller physical separations between 5 and 20 au is the next step for
future planet imagers on 10 m telescopes and ELTs in order to bridge the gap
with indirect techniques (radial velocity, transit, astrometry with Gaia). In
that context, we recently proposed a new algorithm, Keplerian-Stacker,
combining multiple observations acquired at different epochs and taking into
account the orbital motion of a potential planet present in the images to boost
the ultimate detection limit. We showed that this algorithm is able to find
planets in time series of simulated images of SPHERE even when a planet remains
undetected at one epoch. Here, we validate the K-Stacker algorithm performances
on real SPHERE datasets, to demonstrate its resilience to instrumental speckles
and the gain offered in terms of true detection. This will motivate future
dedicated multi-epoch observation campaigns in high-contrast imaging to search
for planets in emitted and reflected light. Results. We show that K-Stacker
achieves high success rate when the SNR of the planet in the stacked image
reaches 7. The improvement of the SNR ratio goes as the square root of the
total exposure time. During the blind test and the redetection of HD 95086 b,

observed, current and near-future surveys are coming online with the capability
of providing photometry of almost the entire visible sky to depths up to R ~ 22
mag or fainter every few days, which will contribute to the detection of black
holes and exoplanets through follow-up observations of microlensing events.
Based on galactic models, we can expect microlensing events across a vastly
wider region of the galaxy, although the cadence of these surveys (2-3 per day
) is lower than traditional microlensing surveys, making efficient detection a
challenge. Rapid advances are being made in the utility of time-series data to
detect and classify transient events in real-time using very high data-rate
surveys, but limited work has been published regarding the detection of
microlensing events, particularly for when the data streams are of relatively
low-cadence. In this research, we explore the utility of a Random Forest
algorithm for identifying microlensing signals using time-series data, with the
goal of creating an efficient machine learning classifier that can be applied
to search for microlensing in wide-field surveys even with low-cadence data. We
have applied and optimized our classifier using the OGLE-II microlensing

propose a deep neural network architecture that not only captures the

learns important time points by utilizing a self-attention mechanism. We show
the validity of the proposed approach across different data sampling strategies

systems learn to modify these representations remains far from understood. Here
we demonstrate that a recurrent neural network (RNN) can learn to modify its
representation of complex information using only examples, and we explain the
associated learning mechanism with new theory. Specifically, we drive an RNN
with examples of translated, linearly transformed, or pre-bifurcated time
series from a chaotic Lorenz system, alongside an additional control signal
that changes value for each example. By training the network to replicate the
Lorenz inputs, it learns to autonomously evolve about a Lorenz-shaped manifold.
Additionally, it learns to continuously interpolate and extrapolate the
translation, transformation, and bifurcation of this representation far beyond
the training data by changing the control signal. Finally, we provide a
mechanism for how these computations are learned, and demonstrate that a single
network can simultaneously learn multiple computations. Together, our results
provide a simple but powerful mechanism by which an RNN can learn to manipulate
internal representations of complex information, allowing for the principled
study and precise design of RNNs.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The ability to store and manipulate information is a hallmark of\ncomputational systems.

we assume that the factor process captures the temporal-dependence and the

is characterized by slow progression over several years, with no treatments or
available medicines. In this regard, there have been efforts to identify the
risk of developing AD in its earliest time. While many of the previous works
considered cross-sectional analysis, more recent studies have focused on the
diagnosis and prognosis of AD with longitudinal or time series data in a way of
disease progression modeling (DPM). Under the same problem settings, in this
work, we propose a novel computational framework that can predict the
phenotypic measurements of MRI biomarkers and trajectories of clinical status
along with cognitive scores at multiple future time points. However, in
handling time series data, it generally faces with many unexpected missing
observations. In regard to such an unfavorable situation, we define a secondary
problem of estimating those missing values and tackle it in a systematic way by
taking account of temporal and multivariate relations inherent in time series
data. Concretely, we propose a deep recurrent network that jointly tackles the
four problems of (i) missing value imputation, (ii) phenotypic measurements
forecasting, (iii) trajectory estimation of the cognitive score, and (iv)
clinical status prediction of a subject based on his/her longitudinal imaging
biomarkers. Notably, the learnable model parameters of our network are trained
in an end-to-end manner with our circumspectly defined loss function. In our

state-of-the-art on various human activity recognition (HAR) datasets. However,
deep CNNs often require more computing resources, which limits their
applications in embedded HAR. Although many successful methods have been
proposed to reduce memory and FLOPs of CNNs, they often involve special network
architectures designed for visual tasks, which are not suitable for deep HAR
tasks with time series sensor signals, due to remarkable discrepancy.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop lightweight deep models to perform HAR.
As filter is the basic unit in constructing CNNs, it deserves further research
whether re-designing smaller filters is applicable for deep HAR. In the paper,
inspired by the idea, we proposed a lightweight CNN using Lego filters for HAR.
A set of lower-dimensional filters is used as Lego bricks to be stacked for
conventional filters, which does not rely on any special network structure. The
local loss function is used to train model. To our knowledge, this is the first
paper that proposes lightweight CNN for HAR in ubiquitous and wearable
computing arena. The experiment results on five public HAR datasets, UCI-HAR
dataset, OPPORTUNITY dataset, UNIMIB-SHAR dataset, PAMAP2 dataset, and WISDM
dataset collected from either smartphones or multiple sensor nodes, indicate
that our novel Lego CNN with local loss can greatly reduce memory and

based on Temporal-Framing Adaptive Network (TFAN), including state transition
loss and dynamic inference for decoding the most likely state sequence.
Methods: In contrast to previous state-of-the-art approaches, the TFAN-based
method does not require any knowledge of the state duration of heart sounds and
is therefore likely to generalize to non sinus rhythm. The TFAN-based method
was trained on 50 recordings randomly chosen from Training set A of the 2016
PhysioNet/Computer in Cardiology Challenge and tested on the other 12
independent training and test databases (2099 recordings and 52180 beats). The
databases for segmentation were separated into three levels of increasing
difficulty (LEVEL-I, -II and -III) for performance reporting. Results: The
TFAN-based method achieved a superior F1 score for all 12 databases except for
`Test-B', with an average of 96.7%, compared to 94.6% for the state-of-the-art
method. Moreover, the TFAN-based method achieved an overall F1 score of 99.2%,
94.4%, 91.4% on LEVEL-I, -II and -III data respectively, compared to 98.4%,
88.54% and 79.80% for the current state-of-the-art method. Conclusion: The
TFAN-based method therefore provides a substantial improvement, particularly
for more difficult cases, and on data sets not represented in the public

to apply to other non-stationary time series. Further work is required to

but also challenging problems in many different fields. In this study, we
propose a new type of interpretable network called the ordinary differential
equation network (ODENet), in which the numerical integration of explicit
ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are embedded into the machine learning
scheme to build a general framework for revealing the hidden dynamics buried in
massive time-series data efficiently and reliably. ODENet takes full advantage
of both machine learning algorithms and ODE modeling. On one hand, the
embedding of ODEs makes the framework more interpretable benefiting from the
mature theories of ODEs. On the other hand, the schemes of machine learning
enable data handling, paralleling, and optimization to be easily and
efficiently implemented. From classical Lotka-Volterra equations to chaotic

so-called Maunder minimum phase. It consists of the lowest sunspot's counting
ever registered for the Sun, and never so far confirmed for other stars. Since
the spectroscopic observations of stellar activity at the Mount Wilson
Observatory, the solar analog HD43587 has shown a very low and apparently
invariant activity level, which makes it a Maunder minimum candidate. We
analyze the chromospheric activity evolution of HD43587 and its evolutive
status, intending to unravel the reasons for this low and flat activity. We use
an activity measurements dataset available in the literature, and compute the

and activity calibrations, to determine its rotation period. Finally, based on
an evolutionary model and the inferred rotation period, we use the EULAG-MHD
code to perform global MHD simulations of HD43587 with the aim of getting some
insights about its dynamo process. We confirm the almost flat activity profile,
with a cycle period $P_{\mathrm{cyc}} = 10.44\pm3.03$ yrs deduced from the
S-index time series, and a long-term trend that might be a period larger than
50 yrs. It was impossible to define a rotation period from the light-curve,

estimate of $\overline{P}_{\mathrm{rot}} = 22.6 \pm 1.9$ d. Furthermore, the
MHD simulations confirm an oscillatory dynamo with a cycle period in good
agreement with the observations and a low level of surface magnetic activity.

assess the science. Unfortunately, a side effect of having a highly complete
sample, is also having a high level of contamination by non-variable

deal with this, we also provide some flags and parameters that can be used by
the community to de-crease the number of variable candidates without heavily

main classes: atmospheric, catchment and river system drivers. In this work, we
propose a data-based attribution approach for selecting which driver best
relates to variations in time of the flood frequency curve. The flood peaks are
assumed to follow a Gumbel distribution, whose location parameter changes in
time as a function of the decadal variations of one of the following
alternative covariates: annual and extreme precipitation for different
durations, an agricultural land-use intensification index, and reservoir
construction in the catchment, quantified by an index. The parameters of this
attribution model are estimated by Bayesian inference. Prior information on one
of these parameters, the elasticity of flood peaks to the respective driver, is
taken from the existing literature to increase the robustness of the method to
spurious correlations between flood and covariate time series. Therefore, the
attribution model is informed in two ways: by the use of covariates,
representing the drivers of change, and by the priors, representing the
hydrological understanding of how these covariates influence floods. The
Watanabe-Akaike information criterion is used to compare models involving
alternative covariates. We apply the approach to 96 catchments in Upper
Austria, where positive flood peak trends have been observed in the past 50
years. Results show that, in Upper Austria, one or seven day extreme
precipitation is usually a better covariate for variations of the flood
frequency curve than precipitation at longer time scales. Agricultural land-use

In this work, we\npropose a data-based attribution approach for selecting which driver best\nrelates to variations in time of the flood frequency curve. The flood peaks are\nassumed to follow a Gumbel distribution, whose location parameter changes in\ntime as a function of the decadal variations of one of the following\nalternative covariates: annual and extreme precipitation for different\ndurations, an agricultural land-use intensification index, and reservoir\nconstruction in the catchment, quantified by an index. The parameters of this\nattribution model are estimated by Bayesian inference. Prior information on one\nof these parameters, the elasticity of flood peaks to the respective driver, is\ntaken from the existing literature to increase the robustness of the method to\nspurious correlations between flood and covariate time series. Therefore, the\nattribution model is informed in two ways: by the use of covariates,\nrepresenting the drivers of change, and by the priors, representing the\nhydrological understanding of how these covariates influence floods. The\nWatanabe-Akaike information criterion is used to compare models involving\nalternative covariates. We apply the approach to 96 catchments in Upper\nAustria, where positive flood peak trends have been observed in the past 50\nyears. Results show that, in Upper Austria, one or seven day extreme\nprecipitation is usually a better covariate for variations of the flood\nfrequency curve than precipitation at longer time scales.

Instead of the widely used bird's eye view (BEV) representation, we utilize the
native range view (RV) representation of LiDAR data. The RV preserves the full
resolution of the sensor by avoiding the voxelization used in the BEV.
Furthermore, RV can be processed efficiently due to its compactness. Previous
approaches project time-series data to a common viewpoint for temporal fusion,
and often this viewpoint is different from where it was captured. This is
sufficient for BEV methods, but for RV methods, this can lead to loss of
information and data distortion which has an adverse impact on performance. To
address this challenge we propose a simple yet effective novel architecture,
\textit{Incremental Fusion}, that minimizes the information loss by
sequentially projecting each RV sweep into the viewpoint of the next sweep in
time. We show that our approach significantly improves motion forecasting

Overall the GRU\nperforms better for longer time series than the LSTM. We have shown that\nalthough we are reasonable at predicting the direction in which the wildfire\nwill spread, we are not able to asses if the wildfire continues to burn due to\nthe lack of auxiliary data.'}","[{'name': 'Rylan Perumal'}, {'name': 'Terence L van Zyl'}]",{'name': 'Terence L van Zyl'},Terence L van Zyl,10.1109/SAUPEC/RobMech/PRASA48453.2020.9078028,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SAUPEC/RobMech/PRASA48453.2020.9078028', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13040v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.13040v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","2020 International SAUPEC/RobMech/PRASA Conference, Cape Town,

considerable attention in system theory and machine learning as they provide a

learning, say through direct policy updates, often requires assumptions such as

open-loop system is stable. In this paper, we examine online regulation of
(possibly unstable) partially unknown linear systems with no a priori
assumptions on the initial controller. First, we introduce and characterize the

(commonly characterized by stabilizability/controllability). Next, having
access only to the input matrix, we propose the Data-GuidedRegulation (DGR)

also generating informative data that can subsequently be used for data-driven
stabilization or system identification (sysID). The analysis is also related in
spirit, to thespectrum and the ''instability number'' of the underlying linear
system, a novel geometric property studied in this work. We further elucidate
our results by considering special structures for system parameters as well as

In this scenario, it is shown that the new monitoring scheme has asymptotic
level alpha under the null hypothesis of no change and is consistent under the
alternative of a change in at least one component of the high dimensional mean
vector. The approach is based on a new type of monitoring scheme for
one-dimensional data which turns out to be often more powerful than the usually
used CUSUM and Page-CUSUM methods, and the component-wise statistics are

squares.
  The paper presents several new approaches to deal with the above problems. We
provide the results that motivate the use of measures of market
(non-)efficiency, volatility clustering and nonlinear dependence based on
(small) powers of absolute returns and their signed versions. The paper
provides asymptotic theory for sample analogues of the above measures in the
case of general time series, including GARCH-type processes. It further
develops new approaches to robust inference on them in the case of general
GARCH-type processes exhibiting heavy-tailedness properties. The approaches are
based on robust inference methods exploiting conservativeness properties of
t-statistics Ibragimov and Muller (2010,2016) and several new results on their
applicability in the settings considered. In the approaches, estimates of
parameters of interest are computed for groups of data and the inference is
based on t-statistics in resulting group estimates. This results in valid
robust inference under a wide range of heterogeneity and dependence assumptions

increasing attention; however, their empirical performance on benchmark tasks

numerical errors in reverse-mode integration; the naive method directly
back-propagates through ODE solvers, but suffers from a redundantly deep
computation graph when searching for the optimal stepsize. We propose the
Adaptive Checkpoint Adjoint (ACA) method: in automatic differentiation, ACA
applies a trajectory checkpoint strategy which records the forward-mode
trajectory as the reverse-mode trajectory to guarantee accuracy; ACA deletes
redundant components for shallow computation graphs; and ACA supports adaptive
solvers. On image classification tasks, compared with the adjoint and naive
method, ACA achieves half the error rate in half the training time; NODE
trained with ACA outperforms ResNet in both accuracy and test-retest
reliability. On time-series modeling, ACA outperforms competing methods.

by turbulent core convection and from turbulent pressure fluctuations in their
near-surface layers. These IGWs are extremely efficient at transporting angular
momentum and chemical species within stellar interiors, but they remain largely
unconstrained observationally. Aims. We aim to characterise the photometric
detection of IGWs across a large number of O and early-B stars in the
Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, and explain the ubiquitous detection of stochastic
variability in the photospheres of massive stars. Methods. We combined
high-precision time-series photometry from the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite with high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy of 70 stars with
spectral types O and B to probe the relationship between the photometric
signatures of IGWs and parameters such as spectroscopic mass, luminosity, and
macroturbulence. Results. A relationship is found between the location of a
star in the spectroscopic Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and the amplitudes and
frequencies of stochastic photometric variability in the light curves of
massive stars. Furthermore, the properties of the stochastic variability are
statistically correlated with macroturbulent velocity broadening in the
spectral lines of massive stars. Conclusions. The common ensemble morphology
for the stochastic low-frequency variability detected in space photometry and
its relationship to macroturbulence is strong evidence for IGWs in massive
stars, since these types of waves are unique in providing the dominant
tangential velocity field required to explain the observed spectroscopy.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=9000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Context.

society including science. Mining these data meaningfully has become a
considerable challenge and is of the broadest possible interest. The size, both
in numbers of observations and dimensionality thereof, requires data mining
algorithms to possess time complexities with both variables that are linear or
nearly linear. One such algorithm, see Comput. Phys. Commun. 184, 2446-2453
(2013), arranges observations into a sequence called the progress index. The
progress index steps through distinct regions of high sampling density
sequentially. By means of suitable annotations, it allows a compact
representation of the behavior of complex systems, which is encoded in the
original data set. The only essential parameter is a notion of distance between
observations. Here, we present the shared memory parallelization of the key
step in constructing the progress index, which is the calculation of an
approximation of the minimum spanning tree of the complete graph of

Fourier transform, Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), wavelet scalogram,
autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process, continuous-time ARMA (CARMA),
Hurst exponent ($H$), and the $\mathcal{A}-\mathcal{T}$ plane. First, with
extensive simulations we showed that parametric modeling returns unreliable

simulations. For our blazar sample, we find that the power law indices $\beta$
calculated from the Fourier and LSP modeling mostly fall in the range
$1\lesssim\beta\lesssim 2$. Using the wavelet scalograms, we confirm a

decoding and classification in EEG signals. Despite several efforts utilizing
different features of EEG signals, a significant research challenge is to use
time-dependent features in combination with local and global features. There
have been several efforts to remodel the deep learning convolution neural
networks (CNNs) to capture time-dependency information by incorporating
hand-crafted features, slicing the input data in a smaller time-windows, and
recurrent convolution. However, these approaches partially solve the problem,
but simultaneously hinder the CNN's capability to learn from unknown
information that might be present in the data. To solve this, we have proposed
a novel time encoding kernel (EnK) approach, which introduces the increasing
time information during convolution operation in CNN. The encoded information
by EnK lets CNN learn time-dependent features in-addition to local and global
features. We performed extensive experiments on several EEG datasets: cognitive
conflict (CC), physical-human robot collaboration (pHRC), P300 visual-evoked
potentials, movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP). EnK outperforms the
state-of-art by 12\% (F1 score). Moreover, the EnK approach required only one
additional parameter to learn and can be applied to a virtually any CNN
architectures with minimal efforts. These results support our methodology and
show high potential to improve CNN performance in the context of time-series

However, these approaches partially solve the problem,\nbut simultaneously hinder the CNN's capability to learn from unknown\ninformation that might be present in the data.

The encoded information\nby EnK lets CNN learn time-dependent features in-addition to local and global\nfeatures. We performed extensive experiments on several EEG datasets: cognitive\nconflict (CC), physical-human robot collaboration (pHRC), P300 visual-evoked\npotentials, movement-related cortical potentials (MRCP). EnK outperforms the\nstate-of-art by 12\\% (F1 score).

dynamical systems for machine learning tasks. Specifically, we consider
reservoir computing, an efficient framework for online time series processing.
As a reservoir we consider a quantum harmonic network modeling e.g. linear
quantum optical systems. We prove that unlike universal quantum computing,
universal reservoir computing can be achieved without non-Gaussian resources.
We find that encoding the input time series into Gaussian states is both a
source and a means to tune the nonlinearity of the overall input-output map. We
further show that the full potential of the proposed model can be reached by
encoding to quantum fluctuations, such as squeezed vacuum, instead of classical
intense fields or thermal fluctuations. Our results introduce a new research

traces), as well as (2) test outcomes at given times for infection, exposure

infectious to recovered. We develop a Monte Carlo EM algorithm to infer
contact-channel specific infection transmission probabilities. Our algorithm
uses Gibbs sampling to draw samples of the latent infection status of each
