observed time-series data allowing for the understanding, prediction and

variety of fields. Often, however, only part of the system's dynamical
variables can be measured, the measurements are corrupted by noise and the
dynamics is complicated by an interplay of nonlinearity and random
perturbations. The problem of dynamical inference in these general settings is
challenging researchers for decades. We solve this problem by applying a
path-integral approach to fluctuational dynamics, and show that, given the
measurements, the system trajectory can be obtained from the solution of the
certain auxiliary Hamiltonian problem in which measured data act effectively as
a control force driving the estimated trajectory toward the most probable one
that provides a minimum to certain mechanical action. The dependance of the
minimum action on the model parameters determines the statistical distribution
in the model space consistent with the measurements. We illustrate the
efficiency of the approach by solving an intensively studied problem from the
population dynamics of predator-prey system where the prey populations may be
observed while the predator populations or even their number is difficult or

spectroscopy over a time baseline of 53 days. Our derived radial velocity
amplitude spectrum, after subtracting the orbital motion, shows three potential
pulsational modes 3-4 sigma above the mean noise level, at 7201.0s,7014.6s and

single detected periodicity of 7209 s, although weak, is consistent with
theoretical expectations as a function of wavelength.Furthermore, it allows us
to rule out a degree index of l= 3 or l= 5 for that mode. Given the extreme

Beside the scaling behavior, I\nreport that fluctuations in the annual domestic landings have increased in the\nlast 30 years, while the mean of the annual growth rate declined significantly\nafter 1972.'}",[{'name': 'Hiro-Sato Niwa'}],{'name': 'Hiro-Sato Niwa'},Hiro-Sato Niwa,"27 pages, 19 figures","[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2005.10.002', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0601050v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0601050v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'q-bio.PE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'q-bio.PE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2005.10.002,Ecological Informatics 1 (2006) 87-99

It is found\nthat in some specific cases two games both show the $1/f$-scaling behaviors,\nwhich indicate the existence of long range correlation. We also figure out that\nwhen the large degree nodes have high probability to be selected, the PDG\ndisplays a punctuated equilibrium-type behavior. On the contrary, the SG\nexhibits a sudden increase feature. These temporary instable behaviors are\nascribed to the strategy shift of the large degree nodes.""}","[{'name': 'Jie Ren'}, {'name': 'Wen-Xu Wang'}, {'name': 'Gang Yan'}, {'name': 'Bing-Hong Wang'}]",{'name': 'Bing-Hong Wang'},Bing-Hong Wang,"10 pages, 5 figures","[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0603007v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0603007v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,

order of magnitude more frequently than cessations. Rotations occurred with a
monotonically decreasing probability distribution p(Delta theta), i.e. there

dynamics of coupled spatiotemporal systems. The lasers are mutually coupled
with a coupling delay less than the cavity round-trip time. We study
synchronization between the two lasers in the experiment and in a delay
differential equation model of the system. Because the lasers are internally
perturbed by spontaneous emission, we include a noise source in the model to
obtain stochastic realizations of the deterministic equations. Both amplitude
synchronization and phase synchronization are considered. We use the Hilbert
transform to define the phase variable and compute phase synchronization. We
find that synchronization increases with coupling strength in the experiment

parameters, i.e., frequencies, rotation rates, and further studies on the

  Aims: To increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the asteroseismic spectra
computed from time series representative of MOST and CoRoT observations (30-
and 150-day observations).
  Methods: We apply the curvelet transform -- a recent image processing
technique which looks for curved patterns -- to echelle diagrams built using
asteroseismic power spectra. In this diagram the eigenfrequencies appear as
smooth continuous ridges. To test the method we use Monte Carlo simulations of
several sun-like stars with different combinations of rotation rates,

  Results: The filtered diagrams enhance the contrast between the ridges of the
modes and the background allowing a better tagging of the modes and a better
extraction of some stellar parameters. Monte Carlo simulations have also shown
that the region where modes can be detected is enlarged at lower and higher

We also critically evaluate the priority queuing\nmodel proposed by Barab\\'asi to describe the distribution of the waiting times.\nWe show that neither the assumptions nor the predictions of the model are\nplausible, and conclude that a theoretical description of human e-mail\ncommunication patterns remains an open problem.""}","[{'name': 'Daniel B.

Cluster obtained with two ground-based telescopes at different longitudes to
provide simultaneous coverage with the 13-d Chandra observation of the cluster.
The resulting database of simultaneous optical and X-ray light curves for some
800 pre--main-sequence (PMS) stars represents, by a factor of hundreds, the
largest synoptic, multi--wavelength-regime, time-series study of young stars to
date. This database will permit detailed analyses of the relationship between
optical and X-ray variability among a statistically significant ensemble of PMS
stars, with the goal of elucidating the origins of PMS X-ray production. In
this first paper, we present the optical observations, describe the combined
X-ray/optical database, and perform an analysis of time-correlated variability
in the optical and X-ray light curves. We identify 40 stars (representing 5% of
our study sample) with possible time-correlated optical and X-ray variability.
Examples of both positive and negative time-correlations are found, possibly
representing X-ray flares and persistent coronal features associated with both
cool and hot surface spots (i.e. magnetically active regions and accretion
shocks). We also find two possible examples of ""white-light"" flares coincident
with X-ray flares; these may correspond to the impulsive heating phase in
solar-analog flares. However, though interesting, these represent unusual
cases. More generally, we find very little evidence to suggest a direct causal

most likely due to a self-eclipsing accretion hot spot on the white dwarf,
rotating into view every 88.43 minutes. This period is commensurate with the
radial velocity period determined by Schmidt et al. 2005 of ~90 minutes, and
consistent with the rotation period of the accretor being equal to the binary

Koen and Maxted 2006 to provide an accurate ephemeris. We also detect the

variable in an extended state of very low accretion, similar to the
well-studied Polar EF Eri. Alternatively, the putative brown dwarf is not
filling its Roche Lobe and the system is a detached binary in which the white
dwarf is efficiently accreting from the wind of the secondary. Six such
post-common envelope, ``pre-Polar'' systems - termed ``low accretion rate
Polars (LARPs)'' by Schwope et al. 2002 - have previously been identified

recently been detected in the near-IR Debes et al. 2006 but, if detached, it

4258 using the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope.
This galaxy was selected because of its accurate maser-based distance, which is
anticipated to have a total uncertainty of ~3%. The goal of the HST
observations is to provide an absolute calibration of the Cepheid Distance
Scale and to measure its dependence on chemical abundance (the so-called
""metallicity effect"").
  We carried out observations of two fields at different galactocentric
distances with a mean abundance difference of 0.5 dex. We discovered a total of
281 Cepheids with periods ranging from 4 to 45 days (the duration of our
observing window). We determine a Cepheid distance modulus for NGC 4258

the published maser distance to the galaxy, this implies \mu (LMC)=18.41 +-
0.10 (r) +- 0.13 (s) mag or D(LMC)= 48.1 +- 2.3 (r) +- 2.9 (s) kpc. We measure
a metallicity effect of \gamma=-0.29 +- 0.09 (r) +- 0.05 (s) mag/dex. We see no
evidence for a variation in the slope of the Period-Luminosity relation as a
function of abundance.

recent sample of 4 well-observed type Ia SNe and our new calibration of the

surveys have been recognized as a feasible method to detect transiting hot
Jupiters. Many transit surveys are now under way, with instruments ranging from
10-cm cameras to the Hubble Space Telescope. However, the results of these
surveys have been much below the expected capacity, estimated in the dozens of
detections per year. One of the reasons is the presence of systematics (``red
noise'') in photometric time series. In general, yield predictions assume
uncorrelated noise (``white noise''). In this paper, we show that the effect of
red noise on the detection threshold and the expected yields cannot be
neglected in typical ground-based surveys. We develop a simple method to
determine the effect of red noise on photometric planetary transit detections.
This method can be applied to determine detection thresholds for transit
surveys. We show that the detection threshold in the presence of systematics
can be much higher than with the assumption of white noise, and obeys a
different dependence on magnitude, orbital period and the parameters of the
survey. Our method can also be used to estimate the significance level of a
planetary transit candidate (to select promising candidates for spectroscopic
follow-up). We apply our method to the OGLE planetary transit search, and show
that it provides a reliable description of the actual detectionthreshold with
real correlated noise. We point out in what way the presence of red noise could
be at least partly responsible for the dearth of transiting planet detections

composition, these significant events are the signature of a non-Poisson
renewal process. This conclusion is reached using a techniques of statistical
analysis recently developed by our group, the Aging Experiment (AE). First, we
find that in both cases the distances between two consecutive events are
described by non-exponential histograms, thereby proving the non-Poisson nature
of these processes. The corresponding survival probabilities $\Psi(t)$ are well
fitted by stretched exponentials ($\Psi(t) \propto exp(-(\gamma t)^\alpha$),

shows that these are renewal processes. We show that the renewal stretched

tails with an inverse power law structure with power index $\mu = 1 + \alpha$.

data of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous multifrequency observations.
Observations were made at 325, 610, 1400 and 4850 MHz as part of a joint
program between the European Pulsar Network and the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope. The pulse energy time series are analysed to derive improved
statistics of nulling pulses as well as to investigate the frequency dependence
of the phenomenon. The pulsar is observed to be in null state for approximately
15% of the time; however, we find that nulling does not always occur
simultaneously at all four frequencies of observation. We characterise this
""selective nulling'' as a function of frequency, separation in frequency, and
combination of frequencies. The most remarkable case is a significantly large
number of nulls ($\approx$6%) at lower frequencies, that are marked by the
presence of a fairly narrow emission feature at the highest frequency of 4850
MHz. We refer to these as ""low frequency (LF) nulls."" Our analysis shows that
this high frequency emission tends to occur preferentially over a narrow range
in longitude and with pulse widths typically of the order of a few
milliseconds. We discuss the implications of our results for the pulsar
emission mechanism in general and for the broadbandness of nulling phenomenon
in particular. Our results signify the presence of an additional process of
emission which does not turn off when the pulsar nulls at low frequencies, and
becomes more prominent at higher frequencies. Our analysis also hints at a
possible outer gap origin for this new population of pulses, and thus a likely
connection to some high-energy emission processes that occur in the outer parts
of the pulsar magnetosphere.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We revisit the phenomenon of pulse nulling using high-quality single-pulse\ndata of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous multifrequency observations.\nObservations were made at 325, 610, 1400 and 4850 MHz as part of a joint\nprogram between the European Pulsar Network and the Giant Metrewave Radio\nTelescope.

discovered in a number of hard computational problems. The transition is
accompanied by a number of critical phenomena, including the divergent sample
to sample fluctuations of portfolio weights. While the optimization under
variance and mean absolute deviation is always feasible below the critical
value of N/T, expected shortfall and maximal loss display a probabilistic
feasibility problem, in that they can become unbounded from below already for
small values of the ratio N/T, and then no solution exists to the optimization
problem under these risk measures. Although powerful filtering techniques exist
for the mitigation of the above instability in the case of variance, our
findings point to the necessity of developing similar filtering procedures
adapted to the other risk measures where they are much less developed or
nonexistent. Another important message of this study is that the requirement of
robustness (noise-tolerance) should be given special attention when considering
the theoretical and practical criteria to be imposed on a risk measure.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We study the sensitivity to estimation error of portfolios optimized under\nvarious risk measures, including variance, absolute deviation, expected\nshortfall and maximal loss.

``intermediate shocks''. Moreover, we find self-similar features in the
volatility. Specifically, within the aftercrash period there are smaller shocks
that themselves constitute Omori processes on smaller scales, similar to the
Omori process after the large crash. We call these smaller shocks subcrashes,
which are followed by their own aftershocks. We also find similar Omori
processes after intermediate crashes in time regimes without a large market
crash. By appropriate detrending we remove the influence of the crashes and

excellent matches to the point-spread functions (PSF) in other images of the

the kernel parameters using our implementation of OIS within the TRIPP package.

with VLT/UVES. These observations were triggered using the VLT Rapid Response
Mode (RRM), which allows for automated observations of transient phenomena,
without any human intervention. This resulted in the first UVES exposure of
GRB060418 to be started only 10 minutes after the initial Swift satellite
trigger. A sequence of spectra covering 330-670 nm were acquired at 11, 16, 25,
41 and 71 minutes (mid-exposure) after the trigger, with a resolving power of 7
km/s, and a signal-to-noise ratio of 10-15. This time-series clearly shows
evidence for time variability of allowed transitions involving FeII
fine-structure levels, and metastable levels of both FeII and NiII, at the
host-galaxy redshift z=1.490. This is the first report of absorption lines
arising from metastable levels of FeII and NiII along any GRB sightline. We
model the observed evolution of the level populations with three different
excitation mechanisms: collisions, excitation by infra-red photons, and
fluorescence following excitation by ultraviolet photons. Our data allow us to
reject the collisional and IR excitation scenarios with high confidence. The UV
pumping model, in which the GRB afterglow UV photons excite a cloud of atoms
with a column density N, distance d, and Doppler broadening parameter b,
provides an excellent fit, with best-fit values: log N(FeII)=14.75+0.06-0.04,
log N(NiII)=13.84+/-0.02, d=1.7+/-0.2 kpc (but see Appendix A), and b=25+/-3
km/s. The success of our UV pumping modeling implies that no significant amount
of FeII or NiII is present at distances smaller than ~1.7 kpc (but see erratum
in Appendix A), most likely because it is ionized by the GRB X-ray/UV flash.
Because neutral hydrogen is more easily ionized than FeII and NiII, this
minimum distance also applies to any HI present.

accretion as well as ejection processes in the nearly edge-on classical T Tauri
star AA Tau.
  AA Tau's light curve is modulated with a period of 8.22d. The recurrent
luminosity dips are due to the periodic occultation of the central star by the
magnetically-warped inner disk edge located at about 9 Rstar. Balmer line
profiles exhibit a clear rotational modulation of high-velocity redshifted
absorption components with a period of 8.22 days as well, with a maximum
strength when the main accretion funnel flow passes through the line of sight.
At the same time, the luminosity of the system decreases by about 1 mag,
indicative of circumstellar absorption of the stellar photosphere by the
magnetically-warped, corotating inner disk edge. The photospheric and HeI
radial velocities also exhibit periodic variations, and the veiling is
modulated by the appearance of the accretion shock at the bottom of the
accretion funnel. Diagnostics of hot winds and their temporal behaviour are
also presented.
  The peculiar geometry of the young AA Tau system (nearly edge-on) allows us
to uniquely probe the acretion-ejection region close to the star. We find that
most spectral and photometric diagnostics vary as expected from models of
magnetically-channelled accretion in young stars, with a large scale

is a central magnitude in finance closely related to the risk of holding a

points with the research on volatility, the key of the analogy being that
volatility is the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of the random walk for
the price return. We present a formal procedure to extract volatility from
price data, by assuming that it is described by a hidden Markov process which
together with the price form a two-dimensional diffusion process. We derive a
maximum likelihood estimate valid for a wide class of two-dimensional diffusion
processes. The choice of the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (expOU) stochastic
volatility model performs remarkably well in inferring the hidden state of
volatility. The formalism is applied to the Dow Jones index. The main results
are: (i) the distribution of estimated volatility is lognormal, which is
consistent with the expOU model; (ii) the estimated volatility is related to
trading volume by a power law of the form $\sigma \propto V^{0.55}$; and (iii)
future returns are proportional to the current volatility which suggests some

Diffusion theory has many common\npoints with the research on volatility, the key of the analogy being that\nvolatility is the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of the random walk for\nthe price return. We present a formal procedure to extract volatility from\nprice data, by assuming that it is described by a hidden Markov process which\ntogether with the price form a two-dimensional diffusion process. We derive a\nmaximum likelihood estimate valid for a wide class of two-dimensional diffusion\nprocesses. The choice of the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (expOU) stochastic\nvolatility model performs remarkably well in inferring the hidden state of\nvolatility. The formalism is applied to the Dow Jones index. The main results\nare: (i) the distribution of estimated volatility is lognormal, which is\nconsistent with the expOU model; (ii) the estimated volatility is related to\ntrading volume by a power law of the form $\\sigma \\propto V^{0.55}$; and (iii)\nfuture returns are proportional to the current volatility which suggests some\ndegree of predictability for the size of future returns.'}","[{'name': 'Zoltan Eisler'}, {'name': 'Josep Perello'}, {'name': 'Jaume Masoliver'}]",{'name': 'Jaume Masoliver'},Jaume Masoliver,"17 pages, 9 colored figures","[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.76.056105', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0612084v3', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0612084v3', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'physics.data-an', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'q-fin.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,10.1103/PhysRevE.76.056105,Physical Review E 76 (2007) 056105.

nonlinear blind source separation (BSS) seeks to find a ""source"" time series,
comprised of statistically independent combinations of the measured components.
In this paper, we seek a source time series with local velocity cross
correlations that vanish everywhere in stimulus state space. However, in an
earlier paper the local velocity correlation matrix was shown to constitute a
metric on state space. Therefore, nonlinear BSS maps onto a problem of
differential geometry: given the metric observed in the measurement coordinate
system, find another coordinate system in which the metric is diagonal
everywhere. We show how to determine if the observed data are separable in this
way, and, if they are, we show how to construct the required transformation to
the source coordinate system, which is essentially unique except for an unknown
rotation that can be found by applying the methods of linear BSS. Thus, the
proposed technique solves nonlinear BSS in many situations or, at least,
reduces it to linear BSS, without the use of probabilistic, parametric, or
iterative procedures. This paper also describes a generalization of this
methodology that performs nonlinear independent subspace separation. In every
case, the resulting decomposition of the observed data is an intrinsic property
of the stimulus' evolution in the sense that it does not depend on the way the
observer chooses to view it (e.g., the choice of the observing machine's
sensors). In other words, the decomposition is a property of the evolution of
the ""real"" stimulus that is ""out there"" broadcasting energy to the observer.

variability in rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars. We analysed high
signal-to-noise time-series observations of ten sharp-lined roAp stars obtained
with the high-resolution spectrographs attached to the VLT and CFHT telescopes.
We investigated in detail the variations of Pr III, Nd II, Nd III and Tb III
lines and discovered a prominent change of the profile variability pattern with
height in the atmospheres of all studied roAp stars. In every investigated star
profile variability of at least one rare-earth ion is characterized by unusual
blue-to-red moving features - a behaviour inexplicable in the framework of the
standard oblique pulsator model of slowly rotating roAp stars. Using analysis
of the line profile moments and spectrum synthesis calculations, we demonstrate
that unusual oscillations in spectral lines of roAp stars arise from the
pulsational modulation of line widths. This variation occurs approximately in
quadrature with the radial velocity changes, and its amplitude rapidly
increases with height in stellar atmosphere. We propose that the line width
modulation is a consequence of the periodic expansion and compression of
turbulent layers in the upper atmospheres of roAp stars. Thus, the line profile
changes observed in slowly rotating magnetic pulsators should be interpreted as
a superposition of two types of variability: the usual time-dependent velocity
field due to an oblique low-order pulsation mode and an additional line width
modulation, synchronized with the changes of stellar radius. Our explanation of

analysis are applied to the whole historical series and to each observing

modes, characteristic timescales and the signal power spectrum over 3 decades

flaring activity and a superimposition/succession of rapid and slower flares,
with no extraordinary/isolated outbursts but, at any rate, characterized by 1
major active phase in 2001. Several mid-term scales (days, weeks) were found,
the more common falling into values of about 27-28 days, 50-56 days and 76-79

modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and
assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development.
Directly measuring \emph{in vivo} biochemical parameters is difficult, and
collectively fitting them to other data often yields large parameter
uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a
growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield
well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very
poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a `sloppy' spectrum of
parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many
decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether
such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that
every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test
several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In
particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of
ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained.
Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This
difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter
measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be
formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions.

promise for testing stellar structure and evolution more stringently than just
fitting parameters to single field stars. The most ambitious attempt to pursue
these prospects was by Gilliland et al. (1993) who targeted 11 turn-off stars
in the open cluster M67 (NGC 2682), but the oscillation amplitudes were too
small (<20micromag) to obtain unambiguous detections. Like Gilliland et al.
(1993) we also aim at detecting solar-like oscillations in M67, but we target
red giant stars with expected amplitudes in the range 50-500micromag and
periods of 1 to 8 hours. We analyse our recently published photometry
measurements, obtained during a six-week multisite campaign using nine
telescopes around the world. The observations are compared with simulations and
with estimated properties of the stellar oscillations. Noise levels in the
Fourier spectra as low as 27micromag are obtained for single sites, while the
combined data reach 19micromag, making this the best photometric time series of
an ensemble of red giant stars. These data enable us to make the first test of
the scaling relations (used to estimate frequency and amplitude) with an
homogeneous ensemble of stars. The detected excess power is consistent with the
expected signal from stellar oscillations, both in terms of its frequency range
and amplitude. However, our results are limited by apparent high levels of
non-white noise, which cannot be clearly separated from the stellar signal.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Measuring solar-like oscillations in an ensemble of stars in a cluster, holds\npromise for testing stellar structure and evolution more stringently than just\nfitting parameters to single field stars.

in Schwarzschild spacetime. We characterize the chaos using the power spectrum

$1/f$-type fluctuation, depending on the value of the total angular momentum
$J$ and the spin $S$ of the test particle. Therefore we succeed in classifying
the chaotic motions, which have been classified as simply chaotic ones in
former works, into the two distinct types. One is $1/f$, and the other is white
noise. Based on this classification, we plot, in the two-dimensional parameter
space $(J,S)$, the phase diagram for the properties of the chaos. This phase
diagram enables us in principle to guess the properties of the system $(J,S)$
by observing the dynamics of the test particle, even if the motion is chaotic.
Furthermore, we detect that the origin of the $1/f$ fluctuation is that the
particle motion stagnates around regular orbits (tori), while traveling back
and forth between them, which is called ``stagnant motion'' or ``sticky
motion'' in Hamiltonian dynamical systems. The point is that the difference of
the property of the chaos or the power spectra is due to the topological

$X_t=Z_t-\theta_0Z_{t-1}$, with independent and identically distributed
$\{Z_t\}$. This is arguably the simplest time series model that one can write
down. The MA(1) with unit root ($\theta_0=1$) arises naturally in a variety of
time series applications. For example, if an underlying time series consists of
a linear trend plus white noise errors, then the differenced series is an MA(1)
with unit root. In such cases, testing for a unit root of the differenced
series is equivalent to testing the adequacy of the trend plus noise model. The
unit root problem also arises naturally in a signal plus noise model in which
the signal is modeled as a random walk. The differenced series follows a MA(1)
model and has a unit root if and only if the random walk signal is in fact a
constant. The asymptotic theory of various estimators based on Gaussian
likelihood has been developed for the unit root case and nearly unit root case
($\theta=1+\beta/n,\beta\le0$). Unlike standard $1/\sqrt{n}$-asymptotics, these
estimation procedures have $1/n$-asymptotics and a so-called pile-up effect, in
which P$(\hat{\theta}=1)$ converges to a positive value. One explanation for
this pile-up phenomenon is the lack of identifiability of $\theta$ in the
Gaussian case. That is, the Gaussian likelihood has the same value for the two
sets of parameter values $(\theta,\sigma^2)$ and $(1/\theta,\theta^2\sigma^2$).
It follows that $\theta=1$ is always a critical point of the likelihood
function. In contrast, for non-Gaussian noise, $\theta$ is identifiable for all
real values. Hence it is no longer clear whether or not the same pile-up
phenomenon will persist in the non-Gaussian case. In this paper, we focus on
limiting pile-up probabilities for estimates of $\theta_0$ based on a Laplace
likelihood. In some cases, these estimates can be viewed as Least Absolute
Deviation (LAD) estimates.

controlled, self-sustained activity in artificial neural networks. Here we
propose and examine the dHAN concept for autonomous associative thought
processes in dense and homogeneous associative networks. An associative
thought-process is characterized, within this approach, by a time-series of

a memory. The subsequent transient states are characterized by large
associative overlaps, which are identical to acquired patterns. Memory states,
the acquired patterns, have such a dual functionality.

role. The network acquires a discrimination capability, as external stimuli
need to compete with the autonomous activity. Noise in the input is readily
filtered-out.
  Hebbian learning of external patterns occurs coinstantaneous with the ongoing
associative thought process. The autonomous dynamics needs a long-term
working-point optimization which acquires within the dHAN concept a dual

stocks in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are analyzed in this
paper. We use daily closing prices for the period 1996-2006, which coincides
with the period of rapid transformation of the market following liberalization.
The eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\mathbf{C}$, of
NSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE): the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds
expected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time
series. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest
is identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that
occur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with
specific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the
Indian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie
much closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack
of distinct sector identity in the market, with the movement of stocks
dominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit
construction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the
minimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using
an improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode
and random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed

delayed with decreasing frequency. The decay phase is independent of radio

the present time, MHB2000, Malkin's and Lambert's ones, are compared on the
basis of representation of variations of the FCN amplitude and phase predicted
by these models. It is possible to conclude, that the model of the author
provides the most realistic representation of the FCN variations. However, the
specified models are based on representation about single FCN rotational mode.
At the same time, some results of processing of the VLBI observations made

2419 based on B,V,I time-series CCD photometry over about 10 years and
extending beyond the cluster published tidal radius. We have identified 101
variable stars of which 60 are new discoveries, doubling the known RR Lyrae
stars and including 12 SX Phoenicis stars. The average period of the RR Lyrae
stars (<Pab>=0.662 d, and <Pc>=0.366 d, for fundamental-mode -RRab- and
first-overtone pulsators, respectively), and the position in the
period-amplitude diagram both confirm that NGC 2419 is an Oosterhoff II
cluster. The average apparent magnitude of the RR Lyrae stars is <V>=20.31 +/-
0.01 (sigma=0.06, 67 stars) and leads to the distance modulus (m-M)o=19.60 +/-
0.05. The Color-Magnitude Diagram, reaching about 2.6 mag below the cluster
turn-off, does not show clear evidence of multiple stellar populations. Cluster
stars are found until r~ 10.5', and possibly as far as r~15', suggesting that
the literature tidal radius might be underestimated. No extra-tidal structures
are clearly detected in the data. NGC 2419 has many blue stragglers and a well
populated horizontal branch extending from the RR Lyrae stars down to an
extremely blue tail ending with the ""blue-hook"", for the first time recognized
in this cluster. The red giant branch is narrow ruling out significant
metallicity spreads. Our results seem to disfavor the interpretation of NGC

the old, super metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791.
  Methods: The data sample consists of more than 75,000 high-precision CCD time
series measurements in the V band obtained mainly at the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope, with additional data from S. Pedro Martir and Loiano observatories,
over a time span of ten nights. The field covers an area of 42x28 arcmin^2.
  Results: We have discovered 260 new variables and re-determined periods and
amplitudes of 70 known variable stars. By means of a photometric evaluation of
the membership in NGC 6791, and a preliminary membership based on the proper
motions, we give a full description of the variable content of the cluster and
surrounding field in the range 16<V<23.5. Accurate periods can be given for the
variables with P<4.0 d, while for ones with longer periods the limited
time-baseline hampered precise determinations. We categorized the entire sample
as follows: 6 pulsating, 3 irregular, 3 cataclysmic, 89 rotational variables
and 61 eclipsing systems; moreover, we detected 168 candidate variables for
which we cannot give a variability class since their periods are much longer
than our time baseline.
  Conclusions: On the basis of photometric considerations, and of the positions
of the stars with respect to the center of the cluster, we inferred that 11 new
variable stars are likely members of the cluster, for 22 stars the membership
is doubtful and 137 are likely non-members. We also detected an outburst of
about 3 mag in the light curve of a very faint blue star belonging to the
cluster and we suggest that this star could be a new U Gem (dwarf nova)

We also present a preliminary theoretical study showing that the periodic

  Methods: An exhaustive Fourier analysis together with a least-square fitting

independent frequencies and non-periodic trends explain most of the variance. A
theoretical non-adiabatic code applied to stellar models for these stars shows
that g-modes are unstable.
  Results: Both stars show rapid variations in amplitude, probably due to a
beating phenomenon. Four significant frequencies have been detected for each
star. Comparison of the observed amplitude ratios for each pulsational
frequency with those calculated from theoretical pulsation codes allows us to
estimate the pulsation modes associated with the different detected

II. Error analysis""}","The determination of horizontal velocity fields at the solar surface is
crucial to understanding the dynamics and magnetism of the convection zone of
the sun. These measurements can be done by tracking granules.
  Tracking granules from ground-based observations, however, suffers from the
Earth's atmospheric turbulence, which induces image distortion. The focus of
this paper is to evaluate the influence of this noise on the maps of velocity
fields.
  We use the coherent structure tracking algorithm developed recently and apply
it to two independent series of images that contain the same solar signal.
  We first show that a k-\omega filtering of the times series of images is
highly recommended as a pre-processing to decrease the noise, while, in
contrast, using destretching should be avoided. We also demonstrate that the
lifetime of granules has a strong influence on the error bars of velocities and
that a threshold on the lifetime should be imposed to minimize errors. Finally,
although solar flow patterns are easily recognizable and image quality is very
good, it turns out that a time sampling of two images every 21 s is not
frequent enough, since image distortion still pollutes velocity fields at a 30%
level on the 2500 km scale, i.e. the scale on which granules start to behave
like passive scalars.
  The coherent structure tracking algorithm is a useful tool for noise control
on the measurement of surface horizontal solar velocity fields when at least
two independent series are available.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""The determination of horizontal velocity fields at the solar surface is\ncrucial to understanding the dynamics and magnetism of the convection zone of\nthe sun.

stars only < 500 Myr ago, but other work has hinted that older (> 1 Gyr) red
giant branch (RGB) stars may also exist. Our new data, once combined with
archival HST/ACS data, provide a deep and uncontaminated optical
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) that now strongly indicates an RGB. The RGB tip

ten rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars based on spectroscopic time-series
observations. The aim of this analysis is to derive from observations a
complete picture of how the amplitude and phase of magnetoacoustic waves depend
on depth. We find common features in the pulsational behaviour of roAp stars.
Within a sample of representative elements the lowest amplitudes are detected
for Eu II (and Fe in 33 Lib and in HD 19918), then pulsations go through the
layers where Halpha core, Nd, and Pr lines are formed. There RV amplitude
reaches its maximum, and after that decreases in most stars. The maximum RV of
the second REE ions is always delayed relative to the first ions. The largest
phase shifts are detected in Tb III and Th III lines. Pulsational variability
of the Th III lines is detected here for the first time. The Y II lines deviate
from this picture, showing even lower amplitudes than Eu II lines but half a
period phase shift relative to other weakly pulsating lines. The roAp stars
exhibit similarity in the depth-dependence of pulsation phase and amplitude,
indicating similar chemical stratification and comparable vertical mode

of the running and standing wave components. In the atmospheres of roAp stars
with the pulsation frequency below the acoustic cut-off frequency, pulsations
have a standing-wave character in the deeper layers and behave like a running
wave in the outer layers. Cooler roAp stars develop a running wave higher in
the atmosphere. In stars with pulsation frequency close to the acoustic cut-off
one, pulsation waves have a running character starting from deep layers.

Moreover, we found other\nperiodicities at 5.06 c/d, 12.09 c/d, probably present but not secure, and at\n11.70 c/d and 18.09 c/d, uncertain. The latter frequency, if present, should be\nidentifiable as another high azimuthal order sectorial mode and three\nadditional terms, probably due to low-l modes, as proved by the analysis of the\nfirst three moments of the line. Owing to the short time baseline and the\none-site temporal sampling we consider our results only preliminary but\nencouraging for a more extensive multisite campaign. A refinement of the\natmospheric physical parameters of the star has been obtained from our\nspectroscopic data and adopted for preliminary computations of evolutionary\nmodels of gamma Bootis.""}","[{'name': 'R.

need to manage animal and plant populations sustainably, and to protect and
rebuild endangered populations. Effective management requires reliable
mathematical models, so that the effects of management action can be predicted,
and the uncertainty in these predictions quantified. These models must be able
to predict the response of populations to anthropogenic change, while handling
the major sources of uncertainty. We describe a simple ``building block''
approach to formulating discrete-time models. We show how to estimate the
parameters of such models from time series of data, and how to quantify
uncertainty in those estimates and in numbers of individuals of different types

vector magnetograms can be used to determine fluxes of magnetic energy (the
Poynting flux) and helicity across the magnetogram layer, and to provide
time-dependent boundary conditions for data-driven simulations of the solar
atmosphere above this layer. Velocity components perpendicular to the magnetic
field are necessary both to compute these transport rates and to derive model
boundary conditions. Here, we discuss some possible approaches to estimating
perpendicular flows from magnetograms. Since Doppler shifts contain
contributions from flows parallel to the magnetic field, perpendicular
velocities are not generally recoverable from Doppler shifts alone. The
induction equation's vertical component relates evolution in $B_z$ to the
perpendicular flow field, but has a finite null space, meaning some ``null''
flows, e.g., motions along contours of normal field, do not affect $B_z$.
Consequently, additional information is required to accurately specify the
perpendicular flow field. Tracking methods, which analyze $\partial_t B_z$ in a
neighborhood, have a long heritage, but other approaches have recently been
developed. In a recent paper, several such techniques were tested using
synthetic magnetograms from MHD simulations. Here, we use the same test data to
characterize: 1) the ability of the induction equation's normal component, by
itself, to estimate flows; and 2) a tracking method's ability to recover flow

wing of the \halpha line in an active region near the solar disk center. From
these filtergrams we construct both Dopplergrams and summed ``line center''
images. Several dynamic fibrils (DFs) are identified in the summed images. The
data is used to simultaneously measure the proper motion and the Doppler
signals in DFs. For calibration of the Doppler signals we use spatially
resolved spectrograms of a similar active region. Significant variations in the
calibration constant for different solar features are observed, and only
regions containing DFs have been used in order to reduce calibration errors. We
find a coherent behavior of the Doppler velocity and the proper motion which
clearly demonstrates that the evolution of DFs involve plasma motion. The
Doppler velocities are found to be a factor 2--3 smaller than velocities
derived form proper motions in the image plane. The difference can be explained
by the radiative processes involved, the Doppler velocity is a result of the
local atmospheric velocity weighted with the response function. As a result the
Doppler velocity originates from a wide range in heights in the atmosphere.
This is contrasted by the proper motion velocity which is measured from the
sharply defined bright tops of the DFs and is therefore a very local velocity
measure. The Doppler signal originates from well below the top of the DF.

We also\nprovide an exact decomposition of temporal correlation function by using\nKramers-Moyal's coefficients. We show that for the stationary time series, the\ntwo point temporal correlation function has an exponential decaying behavior\nwith a characteristic correlation time scale. Our results confirm that, there\nis no definite relation between correlation and Markov time scales. However\nboth of them behave as monotonic increasing function of discharge current\nintensity. Finally to complete our analysis, the multifractal behavior of\nreconstructed time series using its Keramers-Moyal's coefficients and original\ndata set are investigated. Extended self similarity analysis demonstrates that\nfluctuations in our experimental setup deviates from Kolmogorov (K41) theory\nfor fully developed turbulence regime.""}","[{'name': 'S.

of moving block bootstrap for non-stationary time series with periodic and
almost periodic structure. The parameter of the study is the mean value of the
expectation function. Consistency holds in quite general situations: if all
joint distributions of the series are periodic, then it suffices to assume the
central limit theorem and strong mixing property, together with summability of
the autocovariance function. In the case where the mean function is almost
periodic, we additionally need uniform boundedness of the fourth moments of the
root statistics. It is shown that these theoretical results can be applied in
statistical inference concerning the Fourier coefficients of periodically (PC)

We have concluded that, although a realistic estimation of the J2 rate must

Allframe, DoPhot, and two versions of Source Extractor (SExtractor). The
ability of these algorithms to perform point-source photometry, astrometry,
shape measurements, star-galaxy separation, and to measure objects at low
signal-to-noise is quantified. We also perform a detailed crowded field
comparison of Daophot and Allframe, and profile the speed and memory
requirements in detail for SExtractor. We find that both Daophot and Photo are
able to perform aperture photometry to high enough precision to meet LSST's
science requirements, and less adequately at PSF-fitting photometry. Photo
performs the best at simultaneous point and extended-source shape and
brightness measurements. SExtractor is the fastest algorithm, and recent

with the ACS camera of the Hubble Space Telescope in spectroscopic mode. The

resolution element of ~8 nm, at extremely high accuracy (signal-to-noise ratio
up to 10,000 in 50 nm intervals in each individual spectrum). Using these data,
we disentangle the effects of limb darkening, measurement systematics, and
spots on the surface of the host star, to calculate the wavelength dependence
of the effective transit radius to an accuracy of ~50 km. This constitutes the
``transmission spectrum'' of the planetary atmosphere. It indicates at each
wavelength at what height the planetary atmosphere becomes opaque to the
grazing stellar light during the transit. In this wavelength range, strong
features due to sodium, potassium and water are predicted by atmosphere models
for a planet like HD 189733b, but they can be hidden by broad absorption from
clouds or hazes higher up in the atmosphere.

properties. We study the power of the Fourier transform at different
wavelengths and their phase relations. We perform local thermodynamic
equilibrium inversions of the data to obtain the magnetic field, once including
the Ca spectra. We find that the emission in the Ca II H line core at locations
without detectable photospheric polarization signal is due to waves that
propagate from low forming continuum layers in the line wing up to the line
core. The phase differences of intensity oscillations at different wavelengths
indicate standing waves for v < 2 mHz and propagating waves for higher
frequencies. The waves steepen into shocks in the chromosphere. On average,
shocks are both preceded and followed by intensity reductions. In field-free
regions, the profiles show emission about half of the time. The correlation
between wavelengths and the decorrelation time is significantly higher in the

that in the region considered the magnetic pressure is much larger than the gas

phases of Type I outbursts of EXO 2030+375 are estimated. A possible
correlation between the Type II outburst and optical brightness variations is
investigated. In order to estimate the phases of Type I outbursts, we fitted
Gaussian profiles to the RXTE/ASM and SWIFT/BAT light curves. The time
corresponding to the maximum value of the profiles is treated as the arrival
time of Type I outburst. We used differential magnitudes in the time-series
analysis of the optical light curve. MIDAS and its suitable packages were used
to reduce and analyze the spectra. Prior to the Type II outburst, orbital
phases of Type I outbursts were delayed for 6 days after the periastron
passage, which is consistent with findings of Wilson et al., (2002, 2005).
After the giant Type II outburst, the phase of Type I outbursts underwent a
sudden shift of 13 days after the periastron passage. The amplitudes of Type I
outbursts were increased between MJD 52500 and 53500. These amplitudes then
decreased for 10 orbital cycles until the Type II outburst was triggered. If
the change of outburst amplitudes correlated with the mass accretion, then

the past 25 years, the pulsation frequency spectrum of the rapidly oscillating
Ap (roAp) star gamma Equ has remained poorly understood. Better time-series
photometry, combined with recent advances to incorporate interior magnetic
field geometry into pulsational models, enable us to perform improved
asteroseismology of this roAp star.
  Methods. We obtained 19 days of continuous high-precision photometry of gamma
Equ with the MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) satellite. The
data were reduced with two different reduction techniques and significant
frequencies were identified. Those frequencies were fitted by interpolating a
grid of pulsation models that include dipole magnetic fields of various polar
strengths.
  Results. We identify 7 frequencies in gamma Equ that we associate with 5
high-overtone p-modes and 1st and 2nd harmonics of the dominant p-mode. One of
the modes and both harmonics are new discoveries for this star. Our best model
solution (1.8 M_sun, log T_eff ~ 3.882; polar field strength ~8.1 kG) leads to
unique mode identifications for these frequencies (ell = 0, 1, 2 and 4). This
is the first purely asteroseismic fit to a grid of magnetic models. We measure
amplitude and phase modulation of the primary frequency due to beating with a
closely spaced frequency which had never been resolved. This casts doubts on
theories that such modulation - unrelated to the rotation of the star - is due
to a stochastic excitation mechanism.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Aims.

that could host weather-like phenomena. The detection of photometric or
spectral variability would provide insight into unresolved atmospheric
heterogeneities, such as holes in a global cloud deck.
  Aims: It has been proposed that growth of heterogeneities in the global cloud
deck may account for the L- to T-type transition as brown dwarf photospheres
evolve from cloudy to clear conditions. Such a mechanism is compatible with
variability. We searched for variability in the spectra of five L6 to T6 brown
dwarfs in order to test this hypothesis.
  Methods: We obtained spectroscopic time series using VLT/ISAAC, over
0.99-1.13um, and IRTF/SpeX for two of our targets, in J, H and K bands. We
search for statistically variable lines and correlation between those.
  Results: High spectral-frequency variations are seen in some objects, but
these detections are marginal and need to be confirmed. We find no evidence for
large amplitude variations in spectral morphology and we place firm upper
limits of 2 to 3% on broad-band variability, on the time scale of a few hours.
The T2 transition brown dwarf SDSS J1254-0122 shows numerous variable features,
but a secure variability diagnosis would require further observations.
  Conclusions: Assuming that any variability arises from the rotation of
patterns of large-scale clear and cloudy regions across the surface, we find
that the typical physical scale of cloud cover disruption should be smaller
than 5-8% of the disk area for four of our targets. The possible variations
seen in SDSS J1254-0122 are not strong enough to allow us to confirm the cloud

National Observatory 2.1m, Steward Observatory 2.3m, MDM Observatory 1.3m and
2.4m, Hobby-Eberly 9.2m, and Michigan State University 0.6m telescopes. The
star exhibits emission of varying strength in the cores of H and He I
absorption lines. Emission is also present at 4686 Angstroms (He II) and near
4640/4650 Angstroms (N III/C III). Time-series spectroscopy collected from 2005
July to 2007 June shows coherent, periodic radial velocity variations of the
H-alpha line, which we interpret as orbital motion with a period of
0.1952894(10) days. High-resolution spectra show that there are two emission
components, one broad and one narrow, moving in antiphase, as might arise from
an accretion disk and the irradiated face of the mass donor star. Less
coherent, low-amplitude photometric variability is also present on a timescale
similar to the orbital period. Diffuse interstellar bands indicate considerable
reddening, which however is consistent with a distance of ~100-200 pc. The star
is the likely counterpart of a weak ROSAT X-ray source, whose properties are
consistent with accretion in a cataclysmic variable (CV) binary system. We

magnitude is closely linked to the probability distribution function of the

distribution function analytically and numerically. If we assume that the

large increments are better predictable if the underlying stochastic process
has a Gaussian probability distribution function, whereas larger increments are
harder to predict if the underlying probability distribution function has a

This is achieved by introducing, in a\nrealistic manner, most of the ingredients that will influence LISA's\nsensitivity as well as the application of TDI combinations.

a rigid solid in most of the radiative zone and slowing down in the core (R_sun

convergent estimators whereas, in the high frequency regime, the situation is
much more intricate : only the intermittency coefficient $\lambda^2$ can be
estimated using a consistent estimator. However, we show that, in practical
situations, one can detect the nature of the asymptotic regime (low frequency

can be used to describe the slow decay of the sample autocorrelations of the
squared returns often observed in financial time series, which warrants the
further study of parameter estimation methods for the model. Since the
parameters are changing over time, a successful estimator needs to perform well
for small samples. We propose a kernel normalized-least-squares (kernel-NLS)
estimator which has a closed form, and thus outperforms the previously proposed
kernel quasi-maximum likelihood (kernel-QML) estimator for small samples. The
kernel-NLS estimator is simple, works under mild moment assumptions and avoids
some of the parameter space restrictions imposed by the kernel-QML estimator.
Theoretical evidence shows that the kernel-NLS estimator has the same rate of
convergence as the kernel-QML estimator. Due to the kernel-NLS estimator's ease
of computation, computationally intensive procedures can be used. A
prediction-based cross-validation method is proposed for selecting the
bandwidth of the kernel-NLS estimator. Also, we use a residual-based bootstrap
scheme to bootstrap the tvARCH process. The bootstrap sample is used to obtain
pointwise confidence intervals for the kernel-NLS estimator. It is shown that

We find that the improvement in spatial resolution\nis similar for analyzed recent and archive data. On the other hand, the\nimprovement of photometric contrast is quite poor for the archive data, with\nrespect to the one obtained for the present-day images. We show that the\nquality of restored archive data depends on the photographic calibration\napplied to the original observations. In particular, photometry can be\nrecovered with a restoring algorithm if the photographic-calibration preserves\nthe intensity information stored in the original data, principally outside the\nsolar-disk observations.'}","[{'name': 'Serena Criscuoli'}, {'name': 'Ilaria Ermolli'}]",{'name': 'Ilaria Ermolli'},Ilaria Ermolli,10 pages; 9 figures,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361:20079046', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/0804.1010v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.1010v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'astro-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'astro-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,10.1051/0004-6361:20079046,

The central mystery of Nereid is now to explain the physical mechanism of these
unique brightness changes and why they change with time. To characterize
Nereid's variability, we have been using the SMARTS telescopes on Cerro Tololo

photometric time series of 493 magnitudes on 246 nights mostly in the V-band.

20-year data set is the most comprehensive for any small icy body in our Solar
System. Our yearly light curves show that Nereid displays various types of
behaviors: large amplitude brightenings and fadings (1987 to 1990);
moderate-amplitude variation about the average phase curve (1993-1997, 2003,
2005), moderate-amplitude variation and systematically brighter by roughly
one-quarter magnitude throughout the entire season (2004); and nearly constant
light curves superimposed on a surprisingly large-amplitude opposition surge
(1998, 1999, 2000, 2006). Other than in 2004, Nereid's variations were closely
centered around a constant phase curve that is well fit with a Hapke model for
the coherent backscattering opposition surge mechanism with angular scale of
0.7+-0.1 degrees. In our entire data set from 1987-2006, we find no significant
periodicity. We propose that the year-to-year changes in the variability of
Nereid are caused by forced precession (caused by tidal forces from Neptune) on
the spin axis of a nonspherical Nereid, such that cross-sectional areas and
average albedos change as viewed from Earth.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""Nereid is a small irregular moon of Neptune that displays large-, moderate-,\nand small-amplitude photometric variations on both fast and slow time scales.\nThe central mystery of Nereid is now to explain the physical mechanism of these\nunique brightness changes and why they change with time.

one another also improves at the same time the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of

additional insight to why various approximate (not optimal) estimation

contribution to the variance that would come from the irrelevant, resonant
motion of the oscillator. We discuss how these methods fare when the dominant

density that is inversely proportional to the frequency ($1/f$ noise). We also
construct, in the basis of the driving force, an estimator that performs well
for a mixture of white noise and thermal noise. To find the optimal
multi-parameter estimators for thermal noise, we derive and illustrate a

stellar rotation over a 40'x40' field on the 150 Myr open cluster M35. We
report rotation periods for 441 stars and determine their cluster membership
and binarity based on a decade-long radial-velocity survey, proper-motion
measurements, and multi-band photometric observations. We find that 310 of the
stars with measured rotation periods are late-type members of M35. Their
distribution of rotation periods span more than two orders of magnitude from
~0.1-15 days, not constrained by the sampling frequency and the time-span of
the survey. With an age between the zero-age main-sequence and the Hyades, and
with ~6 times more rotation periods than measured in the Pleiades, M35 permit
detailed studies of early rotational evolution of late-type stars. Nearly 80%
of the 310 rotators lie on two distinct sequences in the color-period plane,
defining clear relations between stellar rotation period and color (mass). The
M35 color-period diagram enables us to determine timescales for the transition
between the two rotational states for G and K dwarfs, respectively. These
timescales are inversely related to the mass of the convective envelope, and
offer constraints on the rates of internal and external angular momentum
transport and of the evolution of stellar dynamos. A comparison to the Hyades,
confirm the Skumanich (1972) spindown-dependence for G dwarfs on one rotational
state, but suggest that K dwarfs spin down more slowly. The locations of the
rotational sequences in the M35 color-period diagram support the use of
rotational isochrones to determine ages for coeval stellar populations. We use
such gyrochronology to determine ""gyro-ages"" for M35. We use the M35 data to

2.643882 +0.000060/-0.000058 d, orbital inclination i = 85.80 +0.21/-0.25 deg,

obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Although this discrepancy has a 92%

curves. Comparisons of all the measured radii to theoretical models suggest
that GJ436b has a H/He envelope of ~10% by mass. We also find that the transit
times for GJ436b are constant to within 10 s over the 11 planetary orbits that
the HST data span. However, the ensemble of published values exhibits a
long-term drift and our mean transit time is 128 s later than that expected
from the Spitzer ephemeris. The sparseness of the currently available data
hinders distinguishing between an error in the orbital period or perturbations
arising from an additional object in the system as the cause of the apparent

studies of AGN jets, focusing on the high-sensitivity X-ray observations that
may shed new light on the forthcoming GLAST era. I will especially present some
examples from most recent Suzaku observations of blazars, which provides
important hints for the shock acceleration in sub-pc scale jets, as well as
particle content in jets. Then I will focus on the neutral iron-line feature
observed in some broad line radio galaxies, as a probe of jet launching and/or
the disk-jet connection. Finally, I will discuss new results of large scale
(kpc to Mpc) jets recently resolved with Chandra X-ray observatory.
Simultaneous monitoring observations in various wavelengths will be
particularly valuable for variable blazar sources, allowing the cross
correlations of time series as well as detailed modeling of the spectral

calculate hundreds of poles of the Z-transform. Evidence of a universal
behaviour in the final statistical distribution of the associated poles and
zeros of the Z-transform is shown. In particular the poles and zeros tend, when
the length of the time series goes to infinity, to a uniform angular
distribution on the unit circle. Therefore at finite order, the roots of unity

processing and combining the data. These involved calculating weights for the

cm/s (2.0 times solar), which is consistent with previous detections from the
ground and by the WIRE spacecraft, and also with the upper limit set by the
MOST spacecraft. The variation of the amplitude during the observing campaign

a slow variation in the radial velocity of Procyon, with good agreement between
different telescopes. These variations are remarkably similar to those seen in

inhomogeneous Poisson processes. The work is motivated by operations management
of queueing systems, in particular, telephone call centers, where accurate
forecasting of call arrival rates is a crucial primitive for efficient staffing
of such centers. Our forecasting approach utilizes dimension reduction through
a factor analysis of Poisson variables, followed by time series modeling of
factor score series. Time series forecasts of factor scores are combined with
factor loadings to yield forecasts of future Poisson rate profiles. Penalized
Poisson regressions on factor loadings guided by time series forecasts of
factor scores are used to generate dynamic within-process rate updating.
Methods are also developed to obtain distributional forecasts. Our methods are

modes (horizontal and vertical oscillations in their fundamental mode and
second harmonic) that may arise in coronal loops, with the aim of determining
how well the individual modes can be uniquely identified from time series of
images. A simple, purely geometrical model is constructed to describe the
different types of kink-mode oscillations. These are then `observed' from a
given direction. In particular, we employ the 3D geometrical parameters of 14
TRACE loops of transverse oscillations to try to identify the correct observed
wave mode. We find that for many combinations of viewing and loop geometry it
is not straightforward to distinguish between at least two types of kink modes
just using time series of images. We also considered Doppler signatures and
find that these can help obtain unique identifications of the oscillation modes
when employed in combination with imaging. We then compare the modeled spatial
signatures with the observations of 14 TRACE loops. We find that out of three
oscillations previously identified as fundamental horizontal mode oscillations,
two cases appear to be fundamental vertical mode oscillations (but possibly
combined with the fundamental horizontal mode), and one case appears to be a
combination of the fundamental vertical and horizontal modes, while in three
cases it is not possible to clearly distinguish between the fundamental mode

In particular, we employ the 3D geometrical parameters of 14\nTRACE loops of transverse oscillations to try to identify the correct observed\nwave mode. We find that for many combinations of viewing and loop geometry it\nis not straightforward to distinguish between at least two types of kink modes\njust using time series of images. We also considered Doppler signatures and\nfind that these can help obtain unique identifications of the oscillation modes\nwhen employed in combination with imaging. We then compare the modeled spatial\nsignatures with the observations of 14 TRACE loops. We find that out of three\noscillations previously identified as fundamental horizontal mode oscillations,\ntwo cases appear to be fundamental vertical mode oscillations (but possibly\ncombined with the fundamental horizontal mode), and one case appears to be a\ncombination of the fundamental vertical and horizontal modes, while in three\ncases it is not possible to clearly distinguish between the fundamental mode\nand the second-harmonic of the horizontal oscillation.

in nature such as atmospheric flows, heartbeat patterns, population dynamics,
etc. The physics of the long-range correlations intrinsic to fractal
fluctuations is not yet identified. It is important to quantify the physics
underlying the irregular fractal fluctuations for predictability studies. A
general systems theory for fractals visualizes the emergence of successively
larger scale fluctuations to result from the space-time integration of enclosed
smaller scale fluctuations. The model predictions are as follows. The
probability distribution and the power spectrum for fractal fluctuations is the
same inverse power law function incorporating the golden mean. The predicted
distribution is close to the Gaussian distribution for small-scale fluctuations
but exhibits fat long tail for large-scale fluctuations with higher probability
of occurrence than predicted by Gaussian distribution. Since the power
(variance i.e. square of eddy amplitude) spectrum also represents the
probability densities as in the case of quantum systems such as the electron or
photon, fractal fluctuations exhibit quantumlike chaos. The fine structure
constant for spectrum of fractal fluctuations is a function of the golden mean
and is analogous to atomic spectra equal to about 1/137. Global gridded time
series data sets of monthly mean temperatures for the period 1880 - 2007/2008
are analysed to show that data sets and corresponding power spectra exhibit
distributions close to the model predicted inverse power law distribution. The

A\ngeneral systems theory for fractals visualizes the emergence of successively\nlarger scale fluctuations to result from the space-time integration of enclosed\nsmaller scale fluctuations. The model predictions are as follows. The\nprobability distribution and the power spectrum for fractal fluctuations is the\nsame inverse power law function incorporating the golden mean. The predicted\ndistribution is close to the Gaussian distribution for small-scale fluctuations\nbut exhibits fat long tail for large-scale fluctuations with higher probability\nof occurrence than predicted by Gaussian distribution. Since the power\n(variance i.e. square of eddy amplitude) spectrum also represents the\nprobability densities as in the case of quantum systems such as the electron or\nphoton, fractal fluctuations exhibit quantumlike chaos. The fine structure\nconstant for spectrum of fractal fluctuations is a function of the golden mean\nand is analogous to atomic spectra equal to about 1/137.

sample of stars ranging from spectral type M0 to M8 aimed at investigating
observationally how dynamo processes operate in stars on both sides of the full
convection threshold (spectral type M4).
  The present paper focuses on early M stars (M0--M3), i.e. above the full
convection threshold. Applying tomographic imaging techniques to time series of
rotationally modulated circularly polarised profiles collected with the NARVAL
spectropolarimeter, we determine the rotation period and reconstruct the
large-scale magnetic topologies of 6 early M dwarfs. We find that early-M stars
preferentially host large-scale fields with dominantly toroidal and
non-axisymmetric poloidal configurations, along with significant differential
rotation (and long-term variability); only the lowest-mass star of our
subsample is found to host an almost fully poloidal, mainly axisymmetric
large-scale field ressembling those found in mid-M dwarfs.
  This abrupt change in the large-scale magnetic topologies of M dwarfs
(occuring at spectral type M3) has no related signature on X-ray luminosities
(measuring the total amount of magnetic flux); it thus suggests that underlying
dynamo processes become more efficient at producing large-scale fields (despite
producing the same flux) at spectral types later than M3. We suspect that this
change relates to the rapid decrease in the radiative cores of low-mass stars
and to the simultaneous sharp increase of the convective turnover times (with
decreasing stellar mass) that models predict to occur at M3; it may also be (at
least partly) responsible for the reduced magnetic braking reported for
fully-convective stars.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We present here additional results of a spectropolarimetric survey of a small\nsample of stars ranging from spectral type M0 to M8 aimed at investigating\nobservationally how dynamo processes operate in stars on both sides of the full\nconvection threshold (spectral type M4).\n  The present paper focuses on early M stars (M0--M3), i.e. above the full\nconvection threshold.

baseline of ~50000 wavelengths were performed to achieve arcsecond angular
resolution. LOFAR's Initial Test Station (LOFAR/ITS, The Netherlands) and the

RESULTS: Strong emission from Jupiter was detected during snapshots of a few

Telescope and Kitt Peak National Observatory, and photometric observations were
obtained at MDM and Baker observatories in 2006. We extracted radial velocity
and equivalent width variations from several Balmer and He I lines in
individual spectra. The pulsation frequencies were separated via phase binning
to detect line-profile variations in Balmer and helium lines, which were
subsequently matched to atmospheric models to infer effective temperature and
gravity changes throughout the pulsation cycle.
  From the photometry we recovered the four previously observed frequencies and
detected a new fifth frequency. From the spectra we directly measured radial
velocity and equivalent width variations for the four main frequencies and from
atmospheric models we successfully inferred temperature and gravity changes for
these four frequencies. We compared amplitude ratios and phase differences of
these quantities and searched for outliers which could be identified as
high-degree modes. These are the first such measurements for a ""normal""

Low resolution spectra were obtained at the Nordic Optical\nTelescope and Kitt Peak National Observatory, and photometric observations were\nobtained at MDM and Baker observatories in 2006. We extracted radial velocity\nand equivalent width variations from several Balmer and He I lines in\nindividual spectra. The pulsation frequencies were separated via phase binning\nto detect line-profile variations in Balmer and helium lines, which were\nsubsequently matched to atmospheric models to infer effective temperature and\ngravity changes throughout the pulsation cycle.\n  From the photometry we recovered the four previously observed frequencies and\ndetected a new fifth frequency. From the spectra we directly measured radial\nvelocity and equivalent width variations for the four main frequencies and from\natmospheric models we successfully inferred temperature and gravity changes for\nthese four frequencies. We compared amplitude ratios and phase differences of\nthese quantities and searched for outliers which could be identified as\nhigh-degree modes.

observe a 20,000 deg$^2$ region about 1000 times during the anticipated 10
years of operations (distributed over six bands, $ugrizy$). Each 30-second long
visit will deliver 5$\sigma$ depth for point sources of $r\sim24.5$ on average.

galaxies and a similar number of stars. We discuss various measurements that
will be automatically performed for these 20 billion sources, and how they can
be used for classification and determination of source physical and other
properties. We provide a few classification examples based on SDSS data, such
as color classification of stars, color-spatial proximity search for wide-angle
binary stars, orbital-color classification of asteroid families, and the
recognition of main Galaxy components based on the distribution of stars in the
position-metallicity-kinematics space. Guided by these examples, we anticipate

tape along with a nonlinear time series analysis of experimental acoustic
emission signals in an effort to understand the origin of intermittent peeling
of an adhesive tape and its connection to acoustic emission. The model
represents the acoustic energy dissipated in terms of Rayleigh dissipation
functional that depends on the local strain rate. We show that the nature of
the peel front exhibits rich spatiotemporal patterns ranging from smooth,
rugged and stuck-peeled configurations that depend on three parameters, namely,
the ratio of inertial time scale of the tape mass to that of the roller, the
dissipation coefficient and the pull velocity. The stuck-peeled configurations
are reminiscent of fibrillar peel front patterns observed in experiments. We
show that while the intermittent peeling is controlled by the peel force
function, the model acoustic energy dissipated depends on the nature of the
peel front and its dynamical evolution. Even though the acoustic energy is a
fully dynamical quantity, it can be quite noisy for a certain set of parameter
values suggesting the deterministic origin of acoustic emission in experiments.
To verify this suggestion, we have carried out a dynamical analysis of
experimental acoustic emission time series for a wide range of traction
velocities. Our analysis shows an unambiguous presence of chaotic dynamics

typical lifetime. Three quarters of the UDs lived for less than 150s and showed
no or little motion. The histogram of the UD diameters exhibits a maximum at
225km, i.e. most of the UDs are spatially resolved. UDs display a typical
horizontal velocity of 420m/s and a typical peak intensity of 51% of the mean

features of a time series representing a risk factor. This tutorial aims to
introduce a number of different stochastic processes that can help in grasping
the essential features of risk factors describing different asset classes or
behaviors. This paper does not aim at being exhaustive, but gives examples and
a feeling for practically implementable models allowing for stylised features
in the data. The reader may also use these models as building blocks to build
more complex models, although for a number of risk management applications the
models developed here suffice for the first step in the quantitative analysis.
The broad qualitative features addressed here are {fat tails} and {mean
reversion}. We give some orientation on the initial choice of a suitable
stochastic process and then explain how the process parameters can be estimated
based on historical data. Once the process has been calibrated, typically
through maximum likelihood estimation, one may simulate the risk factor and
build future scenarios for the risky portfolio. On the terminal simulated
distribution of the portfolio one may then single out several risk measures,

the Spitzer Space Telescope have yielded several direct detections of thermal

arguably one of the most interesting parts of the planet spectrum (from 1 to 3
um) is inaccessible with this satellite. This region is at the peak of the
planet's spectral energy distribution and is also the regime where molecular
absorption bands can significantly influence the measured emission.
  Aims: So far, 2.2 um K-band secondary eclipse measurements, which are
possible from the ground, have not yet lead to secure detections. The aim of
this paper is to measure the secondary eclipse of the very hot Jupiter TrES-3b
in K-band, and in addition to observe its transit, to obtain an accurate planet
radius in the near infrared.
  Methods: We have used the William Herschell Telescope (WHT) to observe the
secondary eclipse, and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) to observe
the transit of TrES-3b. Both observations involved significant defocusing of
the telescope, aimed to produce high-cadence time series of several thousand
frames at high efficiency, with the starlight spread out over many pixels.
  Results: We detect the secondary eclipse of TrES-3b with a depth of
-0.241+-0.043% (~6 sigma). This corresponds to a day-side brightness
temperature of T_B(2.2um)= 2040+-185 K, which is consistent with current models
of the physical properties of this planet's upper atmosphere. The centre of the

Using vector autoregressive (VAR) models, these can be defined based on
non-vanishing coefficients belonging to respective time-lagged instances. As in
most cases a parsimonious causality structure is assumed, a promising approach
to causal discovery consists in fitting VAR models with an additional
sparsity-promoting regularization. Along this line we here propose that
sparsity should be enforced for the subgroups of coefficients that belong to
each pair of time series, as the absence of a causal relation requires the
coefficients for all time-lags to become jointly zero. Such behavior can be
achieved by means of l1-l2-norm regularized regression, for which an efficient
active set solver has been proposed recently. Our method is shown to outperform

strategy to detect reliable solution from a given computed result. In this way,
the computational phenomena, such as computational chaos (CC), computational
periodicity (CP) and computational prediction uncertainty, which are mainly
based on long-term properties of computed time series, can be completely

We\napply our method to over 100,000 astronomical time series from the MACHO\nsurvey, in which 56 different sections of the sky are considered, each with one\nor more known events. Our method was able to recover 100% of these events in\nthe top 1% of the results, essentially pruning 99% of the data. Interestingly,\nour method was able to identify events that do not pass traditional event\ndiscovery procedures.""}","[{'name': 'Dan Preston'}, {'name': 'Pavlos Protopapas'}, {'name': 'Carla Brodley'}]",{'name': 'Carla Brodley'},Carla Brodley,"12 pages, 12 figures, accepted for publication at SIAM SDM09","[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.3329v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/0901.3329v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'astro-ph.IM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'astro-ph.IM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.EP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,

high-dimensional data vectors to develop an archetypal set of states (nodes)

speech patterns as characterized by frequencies in time. The SOM approach is
essentially a neural network model that implements a nonlinear projection from
a high-dimensional input space to a low-dimensional array of neurons. In the
process, it also becomes a clustering technique, assigning to any vector in the
high-dimensional data space the node (neuron) to which it is closest (using,
say, Euclidean distance) in the data space. The number of nodes is thus equal
to the number of clusters. However, the primary use for the SOM is as a
representation technique, that is, finding a set of nodes which
representatively span the high-dimensional space. These nodes are typically
displayed using maps to enable visualization of the continuum of the data
space. The technique does not appear to have been discussed in the statistics
literature so it is our intent here to bring it to the attention of the

of vectors. However, through the introduction of stochasticity in the form of a
space--time process model, we seek to illuminate and interpret its performance

accreting millisecond X-ray pulsars in their quiescence phase, we performed the
observations at high frequencies. Making use of particularly precise orbital
and spin parameters obtained from X-ray observations, we carried out a deep
search for radio-pulsed emission from the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar
XTE J0929-314 in three steps, correcting for the effect of the dispersion due
to the interstellar medium, eliminating the orbital motions effects, and
finally folding the time series.
  No radio pulsation is present in the analyzed data down to a limit of 68
microJy at 6.4 GHz and 26 microJy at 8.5 GHz.
  We discuss several mechanisms that could prevent the detection, concluding
that beaming factor and intrinsic low luminosity are the most likely
explanations.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The aim of this work is to search for radio signals in the quiescent phase of\naccreting millisecond X-ray pulsars, in this way giving an ultimate proof of\nthe recycling model, thereby unambiguously establishing that accreting\nmillisecond X-ray pulsars are the progenitors of radio millisecond pulsars.\n  To overcome the possible free-free absorption caused by matter surrounding\naccreting millisecond X-ray pulsars in their quiescence phase, we performed the\nobservations at high frequencies.

self-sustained neural activity which would be present even in the absence of
external sensory stimuli. Here we study the interrelation between the
self-sustained activity in autonomously active recurrent neural nets and
external sensory stimuli.
  There is no a priori semantical relation between the influx of external
stimuli and the patterns generated internally by the autonomous and ongoing
brain dynamics. The question then arises when and how are semantic correlations
between internal and external dynamical processes learned and built up?
  We study this problem within the paradigm of transient state dynamics for the
neural activity in recurrent neural nets, i.e. for an autonomous neural
activity characterized by an infinite time-series of transiently stable
attractor states. We propose that external stimuli will be relevant during the
sensitive periods, {\it viz} the transition period between one transient state
and the subsequent semi-stable attractor. A diffusive learning signal is
generated unsupervised whenever the stimulus influences the internal dynamics
qualitatively.
  For testing we have presented to the model system stimuli corresponding to

random samplings of a Gaussian distribution. We really need to know the

hypothesis that the measurements are derived from noise. This probability can
be calculated by Bayesian analysis, but this requires one to specify and
evaluate a second hypothesis, that the time series does contain a contribution

ways. We first propose three simple conditions that it seems reasonable to
impose on this function, and show that these conditions may be satisfied by a
simple function with one free parameter. We then define two different ways of
combining information derived from two independent power estimates. We find
that this consistency condition may be satisfied, to good approximation, by a

active stars and that of the Sun. The changes in the activity of our central
star have basic effects on Earth, like variations in the global climate.
Therefore understanding the nature of these variations is extremely important.
The observed variations related to magnetic activity cannot be treated as
stationary periodic variations, therefore methods like Fourier transform or
different versions of periodogramms give only partial information on the nature
of the light variability. We demonstrate that time-frequency distributions
provide useful tools for analyzing the observations of active stars. With test
data we demonstrate that the observational noise has practically no effect on
the determination in the the long-term changes of time-series observations of
active stars. The rotational signal may modify the determined cycles, therefore
it is advisable to remove it from the data. Wavelets are less powerful in

corresponds to real physical motion of a ""hot spot"" inside a radio source. It

While the\nlow-state shows an ellipsoidal modulation, an additional photometric modulation\nappears in the high state, with 0.1 mag amplitude and period 220-280 min. The\nfrequency of this modulation appears to be stable for a month or so, but no\nsingle period was consistently detected from one observing season to the next.\nWe estimate the system luminosity by combining optical measurements with the\narchival X-ray spectrum. The implied mass accretion rate is orders of\nmagnitudes below the predictions for the standard angular momentum loss above\nthe period gap. The system may possibly belong to a largely undiscovered\npopulation of hibernating CVs.""}","[{'name': 'J. R. Thorstensen'}, {'name': 'R. Schwarz'}, {'name': 'A. D. Schwope'}, {'name': 'A.

devoted to the multiplicity of O-type stars in the young open cluster NGC2244
and in the Mon OB2 association. Methods. Our spectroscopic monitoring was
performed over several years, allowing us to probe different time-scales. For
each star, several spectral diagnostic tools are applied, in order to search
for line shifts and profile variations. We also measure the projected
rotational velocity and revisit the spectral classification. Results. In our
sample, several stars were previously considered as spectroscopic binaries,
though only a few scattered observations were available. Our results now reveal
a more complex situation. Our study identifies two new spectroscopic binaries
(HD46149 in NGC2244 and HD46573 in MonOB2). The first object is a long-period
double-lined spectroscopic binary, though the exact value of its period remains
uncertain and the second object is classified as an SB1 system with a period of
about 10.67 days but the time series of our observations do not enable us to
derive a unique orbital solution for this system. We also classify another star
as variable in radial velocity (HD46150) and we detect line profile variations
in two rapid rotators (HD46056 and HD46485). Conclusions. This spectroscopic
investigation places a firm lower limit (17%) on the binary fraction of O-stars
in NGC2244 and reveals the lack of short-period O+OB systems in this cluster.
In addition, a comparison of these new results with two other well-studied

stellar density and binarity, which could provide constraints on the theories
about the formation and early evolution of hot stars.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Aims.

spectral fluctuations regarded as a time series has been recently proposed.
According to this test, the fluctuations of a fully chaotic system should
exhibit 1/f noise, whereas for an integrable system this noise should obey the
1/f^2 power law. In this letter, we show that there is a family of well-known
integrable systems, namely spin chains of Haldane-Shastry type, whose spectral
fluctuations decay instead as 1/f^4. We present a simple theoretical

Separating anomalous objects from well-known classes is an important step
towards the discovery of new classes of astronomical objects. Most anomaly
detection methods for time series data assume either a single continuous time
series or a set of time series whose periods are aligned. Light-curve data
precludes the use of these methods as the periods of any given pair of
light-curves may be out of sync. One may use an existing anomaly detection
method if, prior to similarity calculation, one performs the costly act of
aligning two light-curves, an operation that scales poorly to massive data
sets. This paper presents PCAD, an unsupervised anomaly detection method for
large sets of unsynchronized periodic time-series data, that outputs a ranked
list of both global and local anomalies. It calculates its anomaly score for
each light-curve in relation to a set of centroids produced by a modified
k-means clustering algorithm. Our method is able to scale to large data sets

viewed as a network of interacting currencies. We analyze daily time series of
FX data for a set of 63 currencies, including gold, silver and platinum. We
group together all the exchange rates with a common base currency and study
each group separately. By applying the methods of filtered correlation matrix
we identify clusters of closely related currencies. The clusters are formed
typically according to the economical and geographical factors. We also study
topology of weighted minimal spanning trees for different network
representations (i.e., for different base currencies) and find that in a
majority of representations the network has a hierarchical scale-free
structure. In addition, we analyze the temporal evolution of the network and

of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy, based on B and V time series photometry
obtained with the MagIC camera of the 6.5 m Magellan Clay telescope and
complementary HST archive data. Light curves and accurate periodicities were
obtained for 30 RR Lyrae stars and 1 SX Phoenicis variable. The RR Lyrae sample
includes 15 fundamental-mode pulsators, 13 first-overtone pulsators, 1
candidate double-mode pulsator and one RR Lyrae star with uncertain type
classification.
  The average and minimum periods of the ab-type RR Lyrae stars, <Pab>=0.590
days, P(ab,min)=0.53297 days, and the position in the horizontal branch
type--metallicity plane, indicate that the cluster has Oosterhoff-intermediate
properties, basically confirming previous indications by Mackey & Gilmore
(2003b), although with some differences both in the period and type
classification of individual variables.

existing weak magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere, was first directly
observed in a single event by Nagata et al. (2008) using the high resolution
Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) of the Hinode satellite. Using the same space
telescope, we performed a statistical analysis of convective collapse events.
  Methods. Our data sets consist of high resolution time series of polarimetric
spectral scans of two iron lines formed in the lower photosphere and filter
images in Mg I b2 and Ca II H, spectral lines that are formed in the high
photosphere and the lower chromosphere, respectively. We were thus able to
study the implication of convective collapse events on the high photospheric
and the chromospheric layers. The physical parameters from the full Stokes
profiles were obtained with the MERLIN Milne-Eddington inversion code.
  Results. We found that in all cases, the event was accompanied by a continuum
bright point and nearly always by a brightening in the Ca II H images. The
magnesium dopplergram exhibits a strong downflow in about three quarters of the
events that took place within the field of view of the magnesium dopplergram.

Our results go beyond earlier\nones by allowing non-Gaussian and conditional heteroscedastic errors in the\nARMA and FARIMA models and provide theoretical support for some empirical\nfindings reported in the literature.""}",[{'name': 'Xiaofeng Shao'}],{'name': 'Xiaofeng Shao'},Xiaofeng Shao,38 pages,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5179v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/0906.5179v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'math.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'math.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'math.PR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.ME', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.TH', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': '62M10; 62M07', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,

cluster (age 3 Myr) are studied based on NIR time series photometry supported
by MIR spectral energy distributions. We monitor ~30 young low-mass sources
over 8 nights in the J- and K-band using the duPont telescope at Las Campanas.
We find three objects showing variability with J-band amplitudes >0.5 mag; five
additional objects exhibit low-level variations. All three highly variable
sources have been previously identified as highly variable; thus we establish
the long-term nature of their flux changes. The lightcurves contain periodic
components with timescales of ~0.5-8 days, but have additional irregular
variations superimposed -- the characteristic behaviour for classical T Tauri
stars. Based on the colour variability, we conclude that hot spots are the
dominant cause of the variations in two objects, including one likely brown
dwarf, with spot temperatures in the range of 6000-7000 K. For the third one
(#2), a brown dwarf or very low mass star, inhomogenities at the inner edge of
the disk are the likely origin of the variability. Based on mid-infrared data
from Spitzer, we confirm that the three highly variable sources are surrounded
by circum-(sub)-stellar disks. They show typical SEDs for T Tauri-like objects.
Using SED models we infer an enhanced scaleheight in the disk for the object
#2, which favours the detection of disk inhomogenities in lightcurves and is
thus consistent with the information from variability. In the SOri cluster,
about every fifth accreting low-mass object shows persistent high-level
photometric variability. We demonstrate that estimates for fundamental
parameters in such objects can be significantly improved by determining the
extent and origin of the variations.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The properties of accretion disks around stars and brown dwarfs in the SOri\ncluster (age 3 Myr) are studied based on NIR time series photometry supported\nby MIR spectral energy distributions.

We found that a correct period can be recovered in ~65%\nof the cases if we consider Gaia per CCD time series of a G ~ 18 magnitude\nmultiperiodic ZZ Ceti star with 5%-10% light-curve variation. In the\npre-whitened power spectrum a second correct period was also recovered in ~26%\nof the cases.""}","[{'name': 'M. Varadi'}, {'name': 'L. Eyer'}, {'name': 'S. Jordan'}, {'name': 'N.

epoch time series of observations of a single sky region imaged with a time

analysis of a random error of positions that was shown to be dominated by the
uncertainty of the star photocenter determination. The component of the random
error corresponding to image motion was found to be caused primarily by optical
aberrations and variations of atmospheric PSF size but not by the effect of
atmospheric image motion. Comparison of observed and model annual/monthly epoch
average positions yielded estimates of systematic errors for which temporal
properties and distribution in the CCD plane are given. At frame center, the

The CoRoT short runs give us the opportunity to observe a large
variety of late-type stars through their solar-like oscillations. We report
observations of the star HD175726 that lasted for 27 days during the first
short run of the mission. The time series reveals a high-activity signal and
the power spectrum presents an excess due to solar-like oscillations with a low
signal-to-noise ratio. Aims. Our aim is to identify the most efficient tools to
extract as much information as possible from the power density spectrum.
Methods. The most productive method appears to be the autocorrelation of the
time series, calculated as the spectrum of the filtered spectrum. This method
is efficient, very rapid computationally, and will be useful for the analysis
of other targets, observed with CoRoT or with forthcoming missions such as
Kepler and Plato. Results. The mean large separation has been measured to be
97.2+-0.5 microHz, slightly below the expected value determined from solar
scaling laws.We also show strong evidence for variation of the large separation
with frequency. The bolometric mode amplitude is only 1.7+-0.25 ppm for radial
modes, which is 1.7 times less than expected. Due to the low signal-to-noise
ratio, mode identification is not possible for the available data set of
HD175726. Conclusions. This study shows the possibility of extracting a seismic
signal despite a signal-to-noise ratio of only 0.37. The observation of such a

time series from complex systems. Starting from the concept of recurrences in
phase space, the recurrence matrix of a time series is interpreted as the
adjacency matrix of an associated complex network which links different points
in time if the evolution of the considered states is very similar. A critical
comparison of these recurrence networks with similar existing techniques is
presented, revealing strong conceptual benefits of the new approach which can
be considered as a unifying framework for transforming time series into complex
networks that also includes other methods as special cases.
  It is demonstrated that there are fundamental relationships between the
