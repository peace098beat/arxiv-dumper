observed time-series data allowing for the understanding, prediction and

variables can be measured, the measurements are corrupted by noise and the
dynamics is complicated by an interplay of nonlinearity and random
perturbations. The problem of dynamical inference in these general settings is
challenging researchers for decades. We solve this problem by applying a
path-integral approach to fluctuational dynamics, and show that, given the
measurements, the system trajectory can be obtained from the solution of the
certain auxiliary Hamiltonian problem in which measured data act effectively as
a control force driving the estimated trajectory toward the most probable one
that provides a minimum to certain mechanical action. The dependance of the
minimum action on the model parameters determines the statistical distribution
in the model space consistent with the measurements. We illustrate the
efficiency of the approach by solving an intensively studied problem from the
population dynamics of predator-prey system where the prey populations may be
observed while the predator populations or even their number is difficult or

single detected periodicity of 7209 s, although weak, is consistent with
theoretical expectations as a function of wavelength.Furthermore, it allows us
to rule out a degree index of l= 3 or l= 5 for that mode. Given the extreme

Beside the scaling behavior, I\nreport that fluctuations in the annual domestic landings have increased in the\nlast 30 years, while the mean of the annual growth rate declined significantly\nafter 1972.'}",[{'name': 'Hiro-Sato Niwa'}],{'name': 'Hiro-Sato Niwa'},Hiro-Sato Niwa,"27 pages, 19 figures","[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2005.10.002', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0601050v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/q-bio/0601050v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'q-bio.PE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'q-bio.PE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cond-mat.stat-mech', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,10.1016/j.ecoinf.2005.10.002,Ecological Informatics 1 (2006) 87-99

It is found\nthat in some specific cases two games both show the $1/f$-scaling behaviors,\nwhich indicate the existence of long range correlation. We also figure out that\nwhen the large degree nodes have high probability to be selected, the PDG\ndisplays a punctuated equilibrium-type behavior. On the contrary, the SG\nexhibits a sudden increase feature. These temporary instable behaviors are\nascribed to the strategy shift of the large degree nodes.""}","[{'name': 'Jie Ren'}, {'name': 'Wen-Xu Wang'}, {'name': 'Gang Yan'}, {'name': 'Bing-Hong Wang'}]",{'name': 'Bing-Hong Wang'},Bing-Hong Wang,"10 pages, 5 figures","[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0603007v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0603007v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,

order of magnitude more frequently than cessations. Rotations occurred with a
monotonically decreasing probability distribution p(Delta theta), i.e. there

dynamics of coupled spatiotemporal systems. The lasers are mutually coupled
with a coupling delay less than the cavity round-trip time. We study
synchronization between the two lasers in the experiment and in a delay
differential equation model of the system. Because the lasers are internally
perturbed by spontaneous emission, we include a noise source in the model to
obtain stochastic realizations of the deterministic equations. Both amplitude
synchronization and phase synchronization are considered. We use the Hilbert
transform to define the phase variable and compute phase synchronization. We
find that synchronization increases with coupling strength in the experiment

parameters, i.e., frequencies, rotation rates, and further studies on the

  Aims: To increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the asteroseismic spectra
computed from time series representative of MOST and CoRoT observations (30-
and 150-day observations).
  Methods: We apply the curvelet transform -- a recent image processing
technique which looks for curved patterns -- to echelle diagrams built using
asteroseismic power spectra. In this diagram the eigenfrequencies appear as
smooth continuous ridges. To test the method we use Monte Carlo simulations of
several sun-like stars with different combinations of rotation rates,

  Results: The filtered diagrams enhance the contrast between the ridges of the
modes and the background allowing a better tagging of the modes and a better
extraction of some stellar parameters. Monte Carlo simulations have also shown
that the region where modes can be detected is enlarged at lower and higher

We also critically evaluate the priority queuing\nmodel proposed by Barab\\'asi to describe the distribution of the waiting times.\nWe show that neither the assumptions nor the predictions of the model are\nplausible, and conclude that a theoretical description of human e-mail\ncommunication patterns remains an open problem.""}","[{'name': 'Daniel B.

Cluster obtained with two ground-based telescopes at different longitudes to
provide simultaneous coverage with the 13-d Chandra observation of the cluster.
The resulting database of simultaneous optical and X-ray light curves for some
800 pre--main-sequence (PMS) stars represents, by a factor of hundreds, the
largest synoptic, multi--wavelength-regime, time-series study of young stars to
date. This database will permit detailed analyses of the relationship between
optical and X-ray variability among a statistically significant ensemble of PMS
stars, with the goal of elucidating the origins of PMS X-ray production. In
this first paper, we present the optical observations, describe the combined
X-ray/optical database, and perform an analysis of time-correlated variability
in the optical and X-ray light curves. We identify 40 stars (representing 5% of
our study sample) with possible time-correlated optical and X-ray variability.
Examples of both positive and negative time-correlations are found, possibly
representing X-ray flares and persistent coronal features associated with both
cool and hot surface spots (i.e. magnetically active regions and accretion
shocks). We also find two possible examples of ""white-light"" flares coincident
with X-ray flares; these may correspond to the impulsive heating phase in
solar-analog flares. However, though interesting, these represent unusual
cases. More generally, we find very little evidence to suggest a direct causal

most likely due to a self-eclipsing accretion hot spot on the white dwarf,
rotating into view every 88.43 minutes. This period is commensurate with the
radial velocity period determined by Schmidt et al. 2005 of ~90 minutes, and
consistent with the rotation period of the accretor being equal to the binary

Koen and Maxted 2006 to provide an accurate ephemeris. We also detect the

variable in an extended state of very low accretion, similar to the
well-studied Polar EF Eri. Alternatively, the putative brown dwarf is not
filling its Roche Lobe and the system is a detached binary in which the white
dwarf is efficiently accreting from the wind of the secondary. Six such
post-common envelope, ``pre-Polar'' systems - termed ``low accretion rate
Polars (LARPs)'' by Schwope et al. 2002 - have previously been identified

recently been detected in the near-IR Debes et al. 2006 but, if detached, it

4258 using the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope.
This galaxy was selected because of its accurate maser-based distance, which is
anticipated to have a total uncertainty of ~3%. The goal of the HST
observations is to provide an absolute calibration of the Cepheid Distance
Scale and to measure its dependence on chemical abundance (the so-called
""metallicity effect"").
  We carried out observations of two fields at different galactocentric
distances with a mean abundance difference of 0.5 dex. We discovered a total of
281 Cepheids with periods ranging from 4 to 45 days (the duration of our
observing window). We determine a Cepheid distance modulus for NGC 4258

the published maser distance to the galaxy, this implies \mu (LMC)=18.41 +-
0.10 (r) +- 0.13 (s) mag or D(LMC)= 48.1 +- 2.3 (r) +- 2.9 (s) kpc. We measure
a metallicity effect of \gamma=-0.29 +- 0.09 (r) +- 0.05 (s) mag/dex. We see no
evidence for a variation in the slope of the Period-Luminosity relation as a
function of abundance.

recent sample of 4 well-observed type Ia SNe and our new calibration of the

surveys have been recognized as a feasible method to detect transiting hot
Jupiters. Many transit surveys are now under way, with instruments ranging from
10-cm cameras to the Hubble Space Telescope. However, the results of these
surveys have been much below the expected capacity, estimated in the dozens of
detections per year. One of the reasons is the presence of systematics (``red
noise'') in photometric time series. In general, yield predictions assume
uncorrelated noise (``white noise''). In this paper, we show that the effect of
red noise on the detection threshold and the expected yields cannot be
neglected in typical ground-based surveys. We develop a simple method to
determine the effect of red noise on photometric planetary transit detections.
This method can be applied to determine detection thresholds for transit
surveys. We show that the detection threshold in the presence of systematics
can be much higher than with the assumption of white noise, and obeys a
different dependence on magnitude, orbital period and the parameters of the
survey. Our method can also be used to estimate the significance level of a
planetary transit candidate (to select promising candidates for spectroscopic
follow-up). We apply our method to the OGLE planetary transit search, and show
that it provides a reliable description of the actual detectionthreshold with
real correlated noise. We point out in what way the presence of red noise could
be at least partly responsible for the dearth of transiting planet detections

composition, these significant events are the signature of a non-Poisson
renewal process. This conclusion is reached using a techniques of statistical
analysis recently developed by our group, the Aging Experiment (AE). First, we
find that in both cases the distances between two consecutive events are
described by non-exponential histograms, thereby proving the non-Poisson nature
of these processes. The corresponding survival probabilities $\Psi(t)$ are well
fitted by stretched exponentials ($\Psi(t) \propto exp(-(\gamma t)^\alpha$),

shows that these are renewal processes. We show that the renewal stretched

tails with an inverse power law structure with power index $\mu = 1 + \alpha$.

data of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous multifrequency observations.
Observations were made at 325, 610, 1400 and 4850 MHz as part of a joint
program between the European Pulsar Network and the Giant Metrewave Radio
Telescope. The pulse energy time series are analysed to derive improved
statistics of nulling pulses as well as to investigate the frequency dependence
of the phenomenon. The pulsar is observed to be in null state for approximately
15% of the time; however, we find that nulling does not always occur
simultaneously at all four frequencies of observation. We characterise this
""selective nulling'' as a function of frequency, separation in frequency, and
combination of frequencies. The most remarkable case is a significantly large
number of nulls ($\approx$6%) at lower frequencies, that are marked by the
presence of a fairly narrow emission feature at the highest frequency of 4850
MHz. We refer to these as ""low frequency (LF) nulls."" Our analysis shows that
this high frequency emission tends to occur preferentially over a narrow range
in longitude and with pulse widths typically of the order of a few
milliseconds. We discuss the implications of our results for the pulsar
emission mechanism in general and for the broadbandness of nulling phenomenon
in particular. Our results signify the presence of an additional process of
emission which does not turn off when the pulsar nulls at low frequencies, and
becomes more prominent at higher frequencies. Our analysis also hints at a
possible outer gap origin for this new population of pulses, and thus a likely
connection to some high-energy emission processes that occur in the outer parts

discovered in a number of hard computational problems. The transition is
accompanied by a number of critical phenomena, including the divergent sample
to sample fluctuations of portfolio weights. While the optimization under
variance and mean absolute deviation is always feasible below the critical
value of N/T, expected shortfall and maximal loss display a probabilistic
feasibility problem, in that they can become unbounded from below already for
small values of the ratio N/T, and then no solution exists to the optimization
problem under these risk measures. Although powerful filtering techniques exist
for the mitigation of the above instability in the case of variance, our
findings point to the necessity of developing similar filtering procedures
adapted to the other risk measures where they are much less developed or
nonexistent. Another important message of this study is that the requirement of
robustness (noise-tolerance) should be given special attention when considering
the theoretical and practical criteria to be imposed on a risk measure.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We study the sensitivity to estimation error of portfolios optimized under\nvarious risk measures, including variance, absolute deviation, expected\nshortfall and maximal loss.

``intermediate shocks''. Moreover, we find self-similar features in the
volatility. Specifically, within the aftercrash period there are smaller shocks
that themselves constitute Omori processes on smaller scales, similar to the
Omori process after the large crash. We call these smaller shocks subcrashes,
which are followed by their own aftershocks. We also find similar Omori
processes after intermediate crashes in time regimes without a large market
crash. By appropriate detrending we remove the influence of the crashes and

Mode (RRM), which allows for automated observations of transient phenomena,

GRB060418 to be started only 10 minutes after the initial Swift satellite
trigger. A sequence of spectra covering 330-670 nm were acquired at 11, 16, 25,
41 and 71 minutes (mid-exposure) after the trigger, with a resolving power of 7

evidence for time variability of allowed transitions involving FeII
fine-structure levels, and metastable levels of both FeII and NiII, at the

model the observed evolution of the level populations with three different
excitation mechanisms: collisions, excitation by infra-red photons, and
fluorescence following excitation by ultraviolet photons. Our data allow us to
reject the collisional and IR excitation scenarios with high confidence. The UV
pumping model, in which the GRB afterglow UV photons excite a cloud of atoms

accretion as well as ejection processes in the nearly edge-on classical T Tauri
star AA Tau.
  AA Tau's light curve is modulated with a period of 8.22d. The recurrent
luminosity dips are due to the periodic occultation of the central star by the
magnetically-warped inner disk edge located at about 9 Rstar. Balmer line
profiles exhibit a clear rotational modulation of high-velocity redshifted
absorption components with a period of 8.22 days as well, with a maximum
strength when the main accretion funnel flow passes through the line of sight.
At the same time, the luminosity of the system decreases by about 1 mag,
indicative of circumstellar absorption of the stellar photosphere by the
magnetically-warped, corotating inner disk edge. The photospheric and HeI
radial velocities also exhibit periodic variations, and the veiling is
modulated by the appearance of the accretion shock at the bottom of the
accretion funnel. Diagnostics of hot winds and their temporal behaviour are
also presented.
  The peculiar geometry of the young AA Tau system (nearly edge-on) allows us
to uniquely probe the acretion-ejection region close to the star. We find that
most spectral and photometric diagnostics vary as expected from models of
magnetically-channelled accretion in young stars, with a large scale

is a central magnitude in finance closely related to the risk of holding a

points with the research on volatility, the key of the analogy being that
volatility is the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of the random walk for
the price return. We present a formal procedure to extract volatility from
price data, by assuming that it is described by a hidden Markov process which
together with the price form a two-dimensional diffusion process. We derive a
maximum likelihood estimate valid for a wide class of two-dimensional diffusion
processes. The choice of the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (expOU) stochastic
volatility model performs remarkably well in inferring the hidden state of
volatility. The formalism is applied to the Dow Jones index. The main results
are: (i) the distribution of estimated volatility is lognormal, which is
consistent with the expOU model; (ii) the estimated volatility is related to
trading volume by a power law of the form $\sigma \propto V^{0.55}$; and (iii)
future returns are proportional to the current volatility which suggests some

Diffusion theory has many common\npoints with the research on volatility, the key of the analogy being that\nvolatility is the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of the random walk for\nthe price return. We present a formal procedure to extract volatility from\nprice data, by assuming that it is described by a hidden Markov process which\ntogether with the price form a two-dimensional diffusion process. We derive a\nmaximum likelihood estimate valid for a wide class of two-dimensional diffusion\nprocesses. The choice of the exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (expOU) stochastic\nvolatility model performs remarkably well in inferring the hidden state of\nvolatility. The formalism is applied to the Dow Jones index. The main results\nare: (i) the distribution of estimated volatility is lognormal, which is\nconsistent with the expOU model; (ii) the estimated volatility is related to\ntrading volume by a power law of the form $\\sigma \\propto V^{0.55}$; and (iii)\nfuture returns are proportional to the current volatility which suggests some\ndegree of predictability for the size of future returns.'}","[{'name': 'Zoltan Eisler'}, {'name': 'Josep Perello'}, {'name': 'Jaume Masoliver'}]",{'name': 'Jaume Masoliver'},Jaume Masoliver,"17 pages, 9 colored figures","[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.76.056105', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0612084v3', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0612084v3', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'physics.data-an', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'q-fin.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,10.1103/PhysRevE.76.056105,Physical Review E 76 (2007) 056105.

nonlinear blind source separation (BSS) seeks to find a ""source"" time series,
comprised of statistically independent combinations of the measured components.
In this paper, we seek a source time series with local velocity cross
correlations that vanish everywhere in stimulus state space. However, in an
earlier paper the local velocity correlation matrix was shown to constitute a
metric on state space. Therefore, nonlinear BSS maps onto a problem of
differential geometry: given the metric observed in the measurement coordinate
system, find another coordinate system in which the metric is diagonal
everywhere. We show how to determine if the observed data are separable in this
way, and, if they are, we show how to construct the required transformation to
the source coordinate system, which is essentially unique except for an unknown
rotation that can be found by applying the methods of linear BSS. Thus, the
proposed technique solves nonlinear BSS in many situations or, at least,
reduces it to linear BSS, without the use of probabilistic, parametric, or
iterative procedures. This paper also describes a generalization of this
methodology that performs nonlinear independent subspace separation. In every
case, the resulting decomposition of the observed data is an intrinsic property
of the stimulus' evolution in the sense that it does not depend on the way the
observer chooses to view it (e.g., the choice of the observing machine's
sensors). In other words, the decomposition is a property of the evolution of
the ""real"" stimulus that is ""out there"" broadcasting energy to the observer.

variability in rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars. We analysed high
signal-to-noise time-series observations of ten sharp-lined roAp stars obtained
with the high-resolution spectrographs attached to the VLT and CFHT telescopes.
We investigated in detail the variations of Pr III, Nd II, Nd III and Tb III
lines and discovered a prominent change of the profile variability pattern with
height in the atmospheres of all studied roAp stars. In every investigated star
profile variability of at least one rare-earth ion is characterized by unusual
blue-to-red moving features - a behaviour inexplicable in the framework of the
standard oblique pulsator model of slowly rotating roAp stars. Using analysis
of the line profile moments and spectrum synthesis calculations, we demonstrate
that unusual oscillations in spectral lines of roAp stars arise from the
pulsational modulation of line widths. This variation occurs approximately in
quadrature with the radial velocity changes, and its amplitude rapidly
increases with height in stellar atmosphere. We propose that the line width
modulation is a consequence of the periodic expansion and compression of
turbulent layers in the upper atmospheres of roAp stars. Thus, the line profile
changes observed in slowly rotating magnetic pulsators should be interpreted as
a superposition of two types of variability: the usual time-dependent velocity
field due to an oblique low-order pulsation mode and an additional line width
modulation, synchronized with the changes of stellar radius. Our explanation of

analysis are applied to the whole historical series and to each observing

modes, characteristic timescales and the signal power spectrum over 3 decades

flaring activity and a superimposition/succession of rapid and slower flares,
with no extraordinary/isolated outbursts but, at any rate, characterized by 1
major active phase in 2001. Several mid-term scales (days, weeks) were found,
the more common falling into values of about 27-28 days, 50-56 days and 76-79

modern biology. Such models typically involve many free parameters, and
assigning their values is often a substantial obstacle to model development.
Directly measuring \emph{in vivo} biochemical parameters is difficult, and
collectively fitting them to other data often yields large parameter
uncertainties. Nevertheless, in earlier work we showed in a
growth-factor-signaling model that collective fitting could yield
well-constrained predictions, even when it left individual parameters very
poorly constrained. We also showed that the model had a `sloppy' spectrum of
parameter sensitivities, with eigenvalues roughly evenly distributed over many
decades. Here we use a collection of models from the literature to test whether
such sloppy spectra are common in systems biology. Strikingly, we find that
every model we examine has a sloppy spectrum of sensitivities. We also test
several consequences of this sloppiness for building predictive models. In
particular, sloppiness suggests that collective fits to even large amounts of
ideal time-series data will often leave many parameters poorly constrained.
Tests over our model collection are consistent with this suggestion. This
difficulty with collective fits may seem to argue for direct parameter
measurements, but sloppiness also implies that such measurements must be
formidably precise and complete to usefully constrain many model predictions.

promise for testing stellar structure and evolution more stringently than just
fitting parameters to single field stars. The most ambitious attempt to pursue
these prospects was by Gilliland et al. (1993) who targeted 11 turn-off stars
in the open cluster M67 (NGC 2682), but the oscillation amplitudes were too
small (<20micromag) to obtain unambiguous detections. Like Gilliland et al.
(1993) we also aim at detecting solar-like oscillations in M67, but we target
red giant stars with expected amplitudes in the range 50-500micromag and
periods of 1 to 8 hours. We analyse our recently published photometry
measurements, obtained during a six-week multisite campaign using nine
telescopes around the world. The observations are compared with simulations and
with estimated properties of the stellar oscillations. Noise levels in the
Fourier spectra as low as 27micromag are obtained for single sites, while the
combined data reach 19micromag, making this the best photometric time series of
an ensemble of red giant stars. These data enable us to make the first test of
the scaling relations (used to estimate frequency and amplitude) with an
homogeneous ensemble of stars. The detected excess power is consistent with the
expected signal from stellar oscillations, both in terms of its frequency range
and amplitude. However, our results are limited by apparent high levels of
non-white noise, which cannot be clearly separated from the stellar signal.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Measuring solar-like oscillations in an ensemble of stars in a cluster, holds\npromise for testing stellar structure and evolution more stringently than just\nfitting parameters to single field stars.

in Schwarzschild spacetime. We characterize the chaos using the power spectrum

$1/f$-type fluctuation, depending on the value of the total angular momentum
$J$ and the spin $S$ of the test particle. Therefore we succeed in classifying
the chaotic motions, which have been classified as simply chaotic ones in
former works, into the two distinct types. One is $1/f$, and the other is white
noise. Based on this classification, we plot, in the two-dimensional parameter
space $(J,S)$, the phase diagram for the properties of the chaos. This phase
diagram enables us in principle to guess the properties of the system $(J,S)$
by observing the dynamics of the test particle, even if the motion is chaotic.
Furthermore, we detect that the origin of the $1/f$ fluctuation is that the
particle motion stagnates around regular orbits (tori), while traveling back
and forth between them, which is called ``stagnant motion'' or ``sticky
motion'' in Hamiltonian dynamical systems. The point is that the difference of
the property of the chaos or the power spectra is due to the topological

$X_t=Z_t-\theta_0Z_{t-1}$, with independent and identically distributed
$\{Z_t\}$. This is arguably the simplest time series model that one can write
down. The MA(1) with unit root ($\theta_0=1$) arises naturally in a variety of
time series applications. For example, if an underlying time series consists of
a linear trend plus white noise errors, then the differenced series is an MA(1)
with unit root. In such cases, testing for a unit root of the differenced
series is equivalent to testing the adequacy of the trend plus noise model. The
unit root problem also arises naturally in a signal plus noise model in which
the signal is modeled as a random walk. The differenced series follows a MA(1)
model and has a unit root if and only if the random walk signal is in fact a
constant. The asymptotic theory of various estimators based on Gaussian
likelihood has been developed for the unit root case and nearly unit root case
($\theta=1+\beta/n,\beta\le0$). Unlike standard $1/\sqrt{n}$-asymptotics, these
estimation procedures have $1/n$-asymptotics and a so-called pile-up effect, in
which P$(\hat{\theta}=1)$ converges to a positive value. One explanation for
this pile-up phenomenon is the lack of identifiability of $\theta$ in the
Gaussian case. That is, the Gaussian likelihood has the same value for the two
sets of parameter values $(\theta,\sigma^2)$ and $(1/\theta,\theta^2\sigma^2$).
It follows that $\theta=1$ is always a critical point of the likelihood
function. In contrast, for non-Gaussian noise, $\theta$ is identifiable for all
real values. Hence it is no longer clear whether or not the same pile-up
phenomenon will persist in the non-Gaussian case. In this paper, we focus on
limiting pile-up probabilities for estimates of $\theta_0$ based on a Laplace
likelihood. In some cases, these estimates can be viewed as Least Absolute
Deviation (LAD) estimates.

controlled, self-sustained activity in artificial neural networks. Here we
propose and examine the dHAN concept for autonomous associative thought
processes in dense and homogeneous associative networks. An associative
thought-process is characterized, within this approach, by a time-series of

a memory. The subsequent transient states are characterized by large
associative overlaps, which are identical to acquired patterns. Memory states,
the acquired patterns, have such a dual functionality.

role. The network acquires a discrimination capability, as external stimuli
need to compete with the autonomous activity. Noise in the input is readily
filtered-out.
  Hebbian learning of external patterns occurs coinstantaneous with the ongoing
associative thought process. The autonomous dynamics needs a long-term
working-point optimization which acquires within the dHAN concept a dual

stocks in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) of India are analyzed in this
paper. We use daily closing prices for the period 1996-2006, which coincides
with the period of rapid transformation of the market following liberalization.
The eigenvalue distribution of the cross-correlation matrix, $\mathbf{C}$, of
NSE is found to be similar to that of developed markets, such as the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE): the majority of eigenvalues fall within the bounds
expected for a random matrix constructed from mutually uncorrelated time
series. Of the few largest eigenvalues that deviate from the bulk, the largest
is identified with market-wide movements. The intermediate eigenvalues that
occur between the largest and the bulk have been associated in NYSE with
specific business sectors with strong intra-group interactions. However, in the
Indian market, these deviating eigenvalues are comparatively very few and lie
much closer to the bulk. We propose that this is because of the relative lack
of distinct sector identity in the market, with the movement of stocks
dominantly influenced by the overall market trend. This is shown by explicit
construction of the interaction network in the market, first by generating the
minimum spanning tree from the unfiltered correlation matrix, and later, using
an improved method of generating the graph after filtering out the market mode
and random effects from the data. Both methods show, compared to developed

delayed with decreasing frequency. The decay phase is independent of radio

the present time, MHB2000, Malkin's and Lambert's ones, are compared on the
basis of representation of variations of the FCN amplitude and phase predicted

provides the most realistic representation of the FCN variations. However, the
specified models are based on representation about single FCN rotational mode.

2419 based on B,V,I time-series CCD photometry over about 10 years and
extending beyond the cluster published tidal radius. We have identified 101
variable stars of which 60 are new discoveries, doubling the known RR Lyrae
stars and including 12 SX Phoenicis stars. The average period of the RR Lyrae
stars (<Pab>=0.662 d, and <Pc>=0.366 d, for fundamental-mode -RRab- and
first-overtone pulsators, respectively), and the position in the
period-amplitude diagram both confirm that NGC 2419 is an Oosterhoff II
cluster. The average apparent magnitude of the RR Lyrae stars is <V>=20.31 +/-
0.01 (sigma=0.06, 67 stars) and leads to the distance modulus (m-M)o=19.60 +/-
0.05. The Color-Magnitude Diagram, reaching about 2.6 mag below the cluster
turn-off, does not show clear evidence of multiple stellar populations. Cluster
stars are found until r~ 10.5', and possibly as far as r~15', suggesting that
the literature tidal radius might be underestimated. No extra-tidal structures
are clearly detected in the data. NGC 2419 has many blue stragglers and a well
populated horizontal branch extending from the RR Lyrae stars down to an
extremely blue tail ending with the ""blue-hook"", for the first time recognized
in this cluster. The red giant branch is narrow ruling out significant
metallicity spreads. Our results seem to disfavor the interpretation of NGC

the old, super metal-rich open cluster NGC 6791.
  Methods: The data sample consists of more than 75,000 high-precision CCD time
series measurements in the V band obtained mainly at the Canada-France-Hawaii
Telescope, with additional data from S. Pedro Martir and Loiano observatories,
over a time span of ten nights. The field covers an area of 42x28 arcmin^2.
  Results: We have discovered 260 new variables and re-determined periods and
amplitudes of 70 known variable stars. By means of a photometric evaluation of
the membership in NGC 6791, and a preliminary membership based on the proper
motions, we give a full description of the variable content of the cluster and
surrounding field in the range 16<V<23.5. Accurate periods can be given for the
variables with P<4.0 d, while for ones with longer periods the limited
time-baseline hampered precise determinations. We categorized the entire sample
as follows: 6 pulsating, 3 irregular, 3 cataclysmic, 89 rotational variables
and 61 eclipsing systems; moreover, we detected 168 candidate variables for
which we cannot give a variability class since their periods are much longer
than our time baseline.
  Conclusions: On the basis of photometric considerations, and of the positions
of the stars with respect to the center of the cluster, we inferred that 11 new
variable stars are likely members of the cluster, for 22 stars the membership
is doubtful and 137 are likely non-members. We also detected an outburst of
about 3 mag in the light curve of a very faint blue star belonging to the
cluster and we suggest that this star could be a new U Gem (dwarf nova)

We also present a preliminary theoretical study showing that the periodic

  Methods: An exhaustive Fourier analysis together with a least-square fitting

independent frequencies and non-periodic trends explain most of the variance. A
theoretical non-adiabatic code applied to stellar models for these stars shows
that g-modes are unstable.
  Results: Both stars show rapid variations in amplitude, probably due to a
beating phenomenon. Four significant frequencies have been detected for each
star. Comparison of the observed amplitude ratios for each pulsational
frequency with those calculated from theoretical pulsation codes allows us to
estimate the pulsation modes associated with the different detected

II. Error analysis""}","The determination of horizontal velocity fields at the solar surface is
crucial to understanding the dynamics and magnetism of the convection zone of
the sun. These measurements can be done by tracking granules.
  Tracking granules from ground-based observations, however, suffers from the
Earth's atmospheric turbulence, which induces image distortion. The focus of
this paper is to evaluate the influence of this noise on the maps of velocity
fields.
  We use the coherent structure tracking algorithm developed recently and apply
it to two independent series of images that contain the same solar signal.
  We first show that a k-\omega filtering of the times series of images is
highly recommended as a pre-processing to decrease the noise, while, in
contrast, using destretching should be avoided. We also demonstrate that the
lifetime of granules has a strong influence on the error bars of velocities and
that a threshold on the lifetime should be imposed to minimize errors. Finally,
although solar flow patterns are easily recognizable and image quality is very
good, it turns out that a time sampling of two images every 21 s is not
frequent enough, since image distortion still pollutes velocity fields at a 30%
level on the 2500 km scale, i.e. the scale on which granules start to behave
like passive scalars.
  The coherent structure tracking algorithm is a useful tool for noise control
on the measurement of surface horizontal solar velocity fields when at least
two independent series are available.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""The determination of horizontal velocity fields at the solar surface is\ncrucial to understanding the dynamics and magnetism of the convection zone of\nthe sun.

stars only < 500 Myr ago, but other work has hinted that older (> 1 Gyr) red
giant branch (RGB) stars may also exist. Our new data, once combined with
archival HST/ACS data, provide a deep and uncontaminated optical
color-magnitude diagram (CMD) that now strongly indicates an RGB. The RGB tip

ten rapidly oscillating Ap (roAp) stars based on spectroscopic time-series
observations. The aim of this analysis is to derive from observations a
complete picture of how the amplitude and phase of magnetoacoustic waves depend
on depth. We find common features in the pulsational behaviour of roAp stars.
Within a sample of representative elements the lowest amplitudes are detected
for Eu II (and Fe in 33 Lib and in HD 19918), then pulsations go through the
layers where Halpha core, Nd, and Pr lines are formed. There RV amplitude
reaches its maximum, and after that decreases in most stars. The maximum RV of
the second REE ions is always delayed relative to the first ions. The largest
phase shifts are detected in Tb III and Th III lines. Pulsational variability
of the Th III lines is detected here for the first time. The Y II lines deviate
from this picture, showing even lower amplitudes than Eu II lines but half a
period phase shift relative to other weakly pulsating lines. The roAp stars
exhibit similarity in the depth-dependence of pulsation phase and amplitude,
indicating similar chemical stratification and comparable vertical mode

of the running and standing wave components. In the atmospheres of roAp stars
with the pulsation frequency below the acoustic cut-off frequency, pulsations
have a standing-wave character in the deeper layers and behave like a running
wave in the outer layers. Cooler roAp stars develop a running wave higher in
the atmosphere. In stars with pulsation frequency close to the acoustic cut-off
one, pulsation waves have a running character starting from deep layers.

Moreover, we found other\nperiodicities at 5.06 c/d, 12.09 c/d, probably present but not secure, and at\n11.70 c/d and 18.09 c/d, uncertain. The latter frequency, if present, should be\nidentifiable as another high azimuthal order sectorial mode and three\nadditional terms, probably due to low-l modes, as proved by the analysis of the\nfirst three moments of the line. Owing to the short time baseline and the\none-site temporal sampling we consider our results only preliminary but\nencouraging for a more extensive multisite campaign. A refinement of the\natmospheric physical parameters of the star has been obtained from our\nspectroscopic data and adopted for preliminary computations of evolutionary\nmodels of gamma Bootis.""}","[{'name': 'R.

need to manage animal and plant populations sustainably, and to protect and
rebuild endangered populations. Effective management requires reliable
mathematical models, so that the effects of management action can be predicted,
and the uncertainty in these predictions quantified. These models must be able
to predict the response of populations to anthropogenic change, while handling
the major sources of uncertainty. We describe a simple ``building block''
approach to formulating discrete-time models. We show how to estimate the
parameters of such models from time series of data, and how to quantify
uncertainty in those estimates and in numbers of individuals of different types

vector magnetograms can be used to determine fluxes of magnetic energy (the
Poynting flux) and helicity across the magnetogram layer, and to provide
time-dependent boundary conditions for data-driven simulations of the solar
atmosphere above this layer. Velocity components perpendicular to the magnetic
field are necessary both to compute these transport rates and to derive model
boundary conditions. Here, we discuss some possible approaches to estimating
perpendicular flows from magnetograms. Since Doppler shifts contain
contributions from flows parallel to the magnetic field, perpendicular
velocities are not generally recoverable from Doppler shifts alone. The
induction equation's vertical component relates evolution in $B_z$ to the
perpendicular flow field, but has a finite null space, meaning some ``null''
flows, e.g., motions along contours of normal field, do not affect $B_z$.
Consequently, additional information is required to accurately specify the
perpendicular flow field. Tracking methods, which analyze $\partial_t B_z$ in a
neighborhood, have a long heritage, but other approaches have recently been
developed. In a recent paper, several such techniques were tested using
synthetic magnetograms from MHD simulations. Here, we use the same test data to
characterize: 1) the ability of the induction equation's normal component, by
itself, to estimate flows; and 2) a tracking method's ability to recover flow

wing of the \halpha line in an active region near the solar disk center. From
these filtergrams we construct both Dopplergrams and summed ``line center''
images. Several dynamic fibrils (DFs) are identified in the summed images. The
data is used to simultaneously measure the proper motion and the Doppler
signals in DFs. For calibration of the Doppler signals we use spatially
resolved spectrograms of a similar active region. Significant variations in the
calibration constant for different solar features are observed, and only
regions containing DFs have been used in order to reduce calibration errors. We
find a coherent behavior of the Doppler velocity and the proper motion which
clearly demonstrates that the evolution of DFs involve plasma motion. The
Doppler velocities are found to be a factor 2--3 smaller than velocities
derived form proper motions in the image plane. The difference can be explained
by the radiative processes involved, the Doppler velocity is a result of the
local atmospheric velocity weighted with the response function. As a result the
Doppler velocity originates from a wide range in heights in the atmosphere.
This is contrasted by the proper motion velocity which is measured from the
sharply defined bright tops of the DFs and is therefore a very local velocity
measure. The Doppler signal originates from well below the top of the DF.

We also\nprovide an exact decomposition of temporal correlation function by using\nKramers-Moyal's coefficients. We show that for the stationary time series, the\ntwo point temporal correlation function has an exponential decaying behavior\nwith a characteristic correlation time scale. Our results confirm that, there\nis no definite relation between correlation and Markov time scales. However\nboth of them behave as monotonic increasing function of discharge current\nintensity. Finally to complete our analysis, the multifractal behavior of\nreconstructed time series using its Keramers-Moyal's coefficients and original\ndata set are investigated. Extended self similarity analysis demonstrates that\nfluctuations in our experimental setup deviates from Kolmogorov (K41) theory\nfor fully developed turbulence regime.""}","[{'name': 'S.

In the case where the mean function is almost\nperiodic, we additionally need uniform boundedness of the fourth moments of the\nroot statistics. It is shown that these theoretical results can be applied in\nstatistical inference concerning the Fourier coefficients of periodically (PC)\nand almost periodically (APC) correlated time series.

We have concluded that, although a realistic estimation of the J2 rate must

be used for predicting the effects on the periodic part of the

research and development tasks, including image subtraction and co-addition,
object detection and measurements, the production of photometric catalogs, and
the creation and stocking of database tables with time-series information. This
testing has been undertaken to evaluate existing photometry algorithms for
consideration by a next-generation image processing pipeline for the Large
Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). We outline the results of our tests for four
packages: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey's (SDSS) Photo package, Daophot and
Allframe, DoPhot, and two versions of Source Extractor (SExtractor). The
ability of these algorithms to perform point-source photometry, astrometry,
shape measurements, star-galaxy separation, and to measure objects at low
signal-to-noise is quantified. We also perform a detailed crowded field
comparison of Daophot and Allframe, and profile the speed and memory
requirements in detail for SExtractor. We find that both Daophot and Photo are
able to perform aperture photometry to high enough precision to meet LSST's
science requirements, and less adequately at PSF-fitting photometry. Photo
performs the best at simultaneous point and extended-source shape and
brightness measurements. SExtractor is the fastest algorithm, and recent
upgrades in the software yield high-quality centroid and shape measurements
with little bias towards faint magnitudes. Allframe yields the best photometric
results in crowded fields.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""We have developed an end-to-end photometric data processing pipeline to\ncompare current photometric algorithms commonly used on ground-based imaging\ndata.

with the ACS camera of the Hubble Space Telescope in spectroscopic mode. The
resulting time series of 675 spectra covers the 550-1050 nm range, with a
resolution element of ~8 nm, at extremely high accuracy (signal-to-noise ratio
up to 10,000 in 50 nm intervals in each individual spectrum). Using these data,
we disentangle the effects of limb darkening, measurement systematics, and
spots on the surface of the host star, to calculate the wavelength dependence
of the effective transit radius to an accuracy of ~50 km. This constitutes the
``transmission spectrum'' of the planetary atmosphere. It indicates at each
wavelength at what height the planetary atmosphere becomes opaque to the
grazing stellar light during the transit. In this wavelength range, strong
features due to sodium, potassium and water are predicted by atmosphere models
for a planet like HD 189733b, but they can be hidden by broad absorption from
clouds or hazes higher up in the atmosphere.
  We observed an almost featureless transmission spectrum between 550 and 1050
nm, with no indication of the expected sodium or potassium atomic absorption
features. Comparison of our results with the transit radius observed in the

indicate standing waves for v < 2 mHz and propagating waves for higher

shocks are both preceded and followed by intensity reductions. In field-free
regions, the profiles show emission about half of the time. The correlation
between wavelengths and the decorrelation time is significantly higher in the

star HD 115226 -- the first high-amplitude rapidly oscillating Ap star
discovered with time-series spectroscopy. Using high-resolution spectra
obtained with the HARPS instrument at the ESO 3.6-m telescope, we detect radial
velocity variations with a period of 10.86 min in Pr III, Nd III, Dy III lines
and in the narrow cores of hydrogen lines. Pulsational amplitudes exceed 1 km/s
in individual lines of Nd III. The presence of running waves in the stellar
atmosphere is inferred from a phase shift between the radial velocity maxima of
rare-earth and hydrogen lines. Our abundance analysis demonstrates that HD
115226 exhibits typical roAp spectroscopic signature, notably ionization
anomaly of Pr, Nd and Dy. We discuss the discovery of pulsations in HD 115226

active and 9 were unresolved and apparently inactive. These include
103P/Hartley 2, the target of the NASA Deep Impact extended mission, EPOXI. For
6 comets we obtained time-series photometry and use this to constrain the shape
and rotation period of these nuclei. The data are not of sufficient quantity or
quality to measure precise rotation periods, but the time-series do allow us to
measure accurate effective radii and surface colours. Of the comets observed
over an extended period, 40P/Vaisala 1, 47P/Ashbrook-Jackson and P/2004 H2
(Larsen) showed faint activity which limited the study of the nucleus.
Light-curves for 94P/Russell 4 and 121P/Shoemaker-Holt 2 reveal rotation
periods of around 33 and 10 hours respectively, although in both cases these
are not unique solutions. 94P was observed to have a large range in magnitudes

rotation period apparent in the first data set. The combined data set shows
that the rotation period is actually longer than 24 hours. A measurement of the

Despite photometry and spectroscopy of its oscillations obtained over
the past 25 years, the pulsation frequency spectrum of the rapidly oscillating
Ap (roAp) star gamma Equ has remained poorly understood. Better time-series
photometry, combined with recent advances to incorporate interior magnetic
field geometry into pulsational models, enable us to perform improved
asteroseismology of this roAp star.
  Methods. We obtained 19 days of continuous high-precision photometry of gamma
Equ with the MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) satellite. The
data were reduced with two different reduction techniques and significant
frequencies were identified. Those frequencies were fitted by interpolating a
grid of pulsation models that include dipole magnetic fields of various polar
strengths.
  Results. We identify 7 frequencies in gamma Equ that we associate with 5
high-overtone p-modes and 1st and 2nd harmonics of the dominant p-mode. One of
the modes and both harmonics are new discoveries for this star. Our best model
solution (1.8 M_sun, log T_eff ~ 3.882; polar field strength ~8.1 kG) leads to
unique mode identifications for these frequencies (ell = 0, 1, 2 and 4). This
is the first purely asteroseismic fit to a grid of magnetic models. We measure
amplitude and phase modulation of the primary frequency due to beating with a
closely spaced frequency which had never been resolved. This casts doubts on
theories that such modulation - unrelated to the rotation of the star - is due
to a stochastic excitation mechanism.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Aims.

that could host weather-like phenomena. The detection of photometric or
spectral variability would provide insight into unresolved atmospheric
heterogeneities, such as holes in a global cloud deck.
  Aims: It has been proposed that growth of heterogeneities in the global cloud
deck may account for the L- to T-type transition as brown dwarf photospheres
evolve from cloudy to clear conditions. Such a mechanism is compatible with
variability. We searched for variability in the spectra of five L6 to T6 brown
dwarfs in order to test this hypothesis.
  Methods: We obtained spectroscopic time series using VLT/ISAAC, over
0.99-1.13um, and IRTF/SpeX for two of our targets, in J, H and K bands. We
search for statistically variable lines and correlation between those.
  Results: High spectral-frequency variations are seen in some objects, but
these detections are marginal and need to be confirmed. We find no evidence for
large amplitude variations in spectral morphology and we place firm upper
limits of 2 to 3% on broad-band variability, on the time scale of a few hours.
The T2 transition brown dwarf SDSS J1254-0122 shows numerous variable features,
but a secure variability diagnosis would require further observations.
  Conclusions: Assuming that any variability arises from the rotation of
patterns of large-scale clear and cloudy regions across the surface, we find
that the typical physical scale of cloud cover disruption should be smaller
than 5-8% of the disk area for four of our targets. The possible variations
seen in SDSS J1254-0122 are not strong enough to allow us to confirm the cloud

star in the Luminous Stars survey, or alternatively as a hot subdwarf. It is
actually a binary star. We present spectroscopy, spectroscopic orbital
elements, and time series photometry, from observations made at the Kitt Peak
National Observatory 2.1m, Steward Observatory 2.3m, MDM Observatory 1.3m and
2.4m, Hobby-Eberly 9.2m, and Michigan State University 0.6m telescopes. The
star exhibits emission of varying strength in the cores of H and He I
absorption lines. Emission is also present at 4686 Angstroms (He II) and near
4640/4650 Angstroms (N III/C III). Time-series spectroscopy collected from 2005
July to 2007 June shows coherent, periodic radial velocity variations of the
H-alpha line, which we interpret as orbital motion with a period of
0.1952894(10) days. High-resolution spectra show that there are two emission
components, one broad and one narrow, moving in antiphase, as might arise from
an accretion disk and the irradiated face of the mass donor star. Less
coherent, low-amplitude photometric variability is also present on a timescale

magnitude is closely linked to the probability distribution function of the

distribution function analytically and numerically. If we assume that the
optimal precursory structures are used to make the predictions, we find that
large increments are better predictable if the underlying stochastic process
has a Gaussian probability distribution function, whereas larger increments are
harder to predict if the underlying probability distribution function has a
power law tail. In the case of an exponential distribution function we find no
significant dependence on the event magnitude. Furthermore we compare these
results with predictions of increments in correlated data, namely, velocity
increments of a free jet flow. The velocity increments in the free jet flow are

and compare observations with predictions from both a 3-D hydrodynamic
simulation of the solar surface (provided by M. Asplund and collaborators) and
1-D model atmospheres. Intensities from the 3-D time series are derived by
means of the new synthesis code ASSET, which overcomes limitations of
previously available codes by including a consistent treatment of scattering
and allowing for arbitrarily complex line and continuum opacities. In the
continuum, we find very similar discrepancies between synthesis and observation
for both types of model atmospheres. This is in contrast to previous studies
that used a ``horizontally'' and time averaged representation of the 3-D model
and found a significantly larger disagreement with observations. The presence
of temperature and velocity fields in the 3-D simulation provides a significant
advantage when it comes to reproduce solar spectral line shapes. Nonetheless, a
comparison of observed and synthetic equivalent widths reveals that the 3-D
model also predicts more uniform abundances as a function of position angle on
the disk. We conclude that the 3-D simulation provides not only a more
realistic description of the gas dynamics, but, despite its simplified

The presence\nof temperature and velocity fields in the 3-D simulation provides a significant\nadvantage when it comes to reproduce solar spectral line shapes. Nonetheless, a\ncomparison of observed and synthetic equivalent widths reveals that the 3-D\nmodel also predicts more uniform abundances as a function of position angle on\nthe disk.

the solar atmosphere in the Ca II K line since the early decades of the 20th

irradiance changes are restricted. We evaluate the image contents of three Ca
II K spectroheliogram time-series, specifically those obtained by the
digitization of the Arcetri, Kodaikanal, and Mt Wilson photographic archives.

results obtained with those for similar present-day observations taken with the
Meudon spectroheliograph and with the Rome-PSPT. We show that historic data
suffer from stronger geometrical distortions and photometric uncertainties than
similar present-day observations. The latter uncertainties mostly originate
from the photographic calibration of the original data and from stray-light
effects. We also show that the image contents of the three analyzed series vary

the spectrographs used, as well as changes of the observing programs. Our
results imply that the main challenge for the analysis of historic data is
their accurate photometric calibration. This problem must be solved before they

assume LTE and are based on the SATIRE (Spectral And Total Irradiance

  Results: In most wavelength regions, the variability agrees well between all
sets of observations and the model calculations. The model does particularly
well between 400 and 1300 nm, but fails below 220 nm as well as for some of the
strong NUV lines. Our calculations clearly show the shift from

in stars of G or later spectral types. Presence and level of magnetic activity
depend on star's rotation and rotation itself is strongly influenced by
strength and topology of the magnetic fields. Open clusters represent
especially useful targets to investigate the connection between rotation and
activity. The open cluster NGC2099 has been studied as a part of the RACE-OC
project, which is aimed at exploring the evolution of rotation and magnetic
activity in the late-type members of open clusters of different ages. Time
series CCD photometric observations of this cluster were collected during
January 2004. The relations between activity manifestations, such as the light
curve amplitude, and global stellar parameters are investigated. We have
discovered 135 periodic variables, 122 of which are candidate cluster members.
Determination of rotation periods of G- and K-type stars has allowed us to
better explore evolution of angular momentum at an age of about 500 Myr. A
comparison with the older Hyades cluster (~625 Myr) shows that the newly
determined distribution of rotation periods is consistent with the scenario of
rotational braking of main-sequence spotted stars as they age. However, a
comparison with the younger M34 cluster (~200 Myr) shows that the G8-K5 members
of these clusters have the same rotation period distribution, that is G8-K5
members in NGC2099 seem to have experienced no significant braking in the age
range from ~200 to ~500 Myr. Finally, NGC2099 members have a level of
photospheric magnetic activity, as measured by light curve amplitude, smaller

the phase information. We consider both solar-like stochastic oscillations and
long-lived harmonic oscillations, plus random noise. Using numerical
simulations, we demonstrate the existence of cases for which our improved
fitting method is less biased and has a greater precision than when the
frequency correlations are ignored. This is especially true of low
signal-to-noise solar-like oscillations. For example, we discuss a case where
the precision on the mode frequency estimate is increased by a factor of five,
for a duty cycle of 15%. In the case of long-lived sinusoidal oscillations, a
proper treatment of the frequency correlations does not provide any significant

Using numerical\nsimulations, we demonstrate the existence of cases for which our improved\nfitting method is less biased and has a greater precision than when the\nfrequency correlations are ignored. This is especially true of low\nsignal-to-noise solar-like oscillations. For example, we discuss a case where\nthe precision on the mode frequency estimate is increased by a factor of five,\nfor a duty cycle of 15%.

However, in contrast to other approaches towards a theoretical\ndescription of spectral properties of systems with mixed dynamics,\nsuperstatistics also provides a description of properties of the\neigenfunctions.

It is shown that it
can be used to describe the slow decay of the sample autocorrelations of the
squared returns often observed in financial time series, which warrants the
further study of parameter estimation methods for the model. Since the
parameters are changing over time, a successful estimator needs to perform well
for small samples. We propose a kernel normalized-least-squares (kernel-NLS)
estimator which has a closed form, and thus outperforms the previously proposed
kernel quasi-maximum likelihood (kernel-QML) estimator for small samples. The
kernel-NLS estimator is simple, works under mild moment assumptions and avoids
some of the parameter space restrictions imposed by the kernel-QML estimator.
Theoretical evidence shows that the kernel-NLS estimator has the same rate of
convergence as the kernel-QML estimator. Due to the kernel-NLS estimator's ease
of computation, computationally intensive procedures can be used. A
prediction-based cross-validation method is proposed for selecting the
bandwidth of the kernel-NLS estimator. Also, we use a residual-based bootstrap
scheme to bootstrap the tvARCH process. The bootstrap sample is used to obtain
pointwise confidence intervals for the kernel-NLS estimator. It is shown that

unique brightness changes and why they change with time. To characterize
Nereid's variability, we have been using the SMARTS telescopes on Cerro Tololo
for synoptic monitoring from 1999 to 2006. We present a well-sampled
photometric time series of 493 magnitudes on 246 nights mostly in the V-band.
In combination with our earlier data (for 774 magnitudes over 362 nights), our
20-year data set is the most comprehensive for any small icy body in our Solar
System. Our yearly light curves show that Nereid displays various types of
behaviors: large amplitude brightenings and fadings (1987 to 1990);
moderate-amplitude variation about the average phase curve (1993-1997, 2003,
2005), moderate-amplitude variation and systematically brighter by roughly
one-quarter magnitude throughout the entire season (2004); and nearly constant
light curves superimposed on a surprisingly large-amplitude opposition surge
(1998, 1999, 2000, 2006). Other than in 2004, Nereid's variations were closely
centered around a constant phase curve that is well fit with a Hapke model for
the coherent backscattering opposition surge mechanism with angular scale of
0.7+-0.1 degrees. In our entire data set from 1987-2006, we find no significant
periodicity. We propose that the year-to-year changes in the variability of
Nereid are caused by forced precession (caused by tidal forces from Neptune) on
the spin axis of a nonspherical Nereid, such that cross-sectional areas and
average albedos change as viewed from Earth.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""Nereid is a small irregular moon of Neptune that displays large-, moderate-,\nand small-amplitude photometric variations on both fast and slow time scales.\nThe central mystery of Nereid is now to explain the physical mechanism of these\nunique brightness changes and why they change with time.

Our yearly light curves show that Nereid displays various types of\nbehaviors: large amplitude brightenings and fadings (1987 to 1990);\nmoderate-amplitude variation about the average phase curve (1993-1997, 2003,\n2005), moderate-amplitude variation and systematically brighter by roughly\none-quarter magnitude throughout the entire season (2004); and nearly constant\nlight curves superimposed on a surprisingly large-amplitude opposition surge\n(1998, 1999, 2000, 2006). Other than in 2004, Nereid's variations were closely\ncentered around a constant phase curve that is well fit with a Hapke model for\nthe coherent backscattering opposition surge mechanism with angular scale of\n0.7+-0.1 degrees. In our entire data set from 1987-2006, we find no significant\nperiodicity. We propose that the year-to-year changes in the variability of\nNereid are caused by forced precession (caused by tidal forces from Neptune) on\nthe spin axis of a nonspherical Nereid, such that cross-sectional areas and\naverage albedos change as viewed from Earth.""}","[{'name': 'Bradley E.

deteriorating condition numbers of (kernel) smoothed periodogram matrices.
Moreover, shrinking the empirical eigenvalues in the frequency domain towards
one another also improves at the same time the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of
these widely used nonparametric spectral estimators. Compared to some existing
time domain approaches, restricted to i.i.d. data, in the frequency domain it
is necessary to take the size of the smoothing span as ""effective or local

multiple of the identity matrix as optimal shrinkage target in the absence of
knowledge about the multidimensional structure of the data, here we consider
""structural"" shrinkage. We assume that the spectral structure of the data is
induced by underlying factors. However, in contrast to actual factor modelling
suffering from the need to choose the number of factors, we suggest a
model-free approach. Our final estimator is the asymptotically MSE-optimal
linear combination of the smoothed periodogram and the parametric estimator

reveals a dominant periodicity at 44.779 +/- 0.038 min which is not related to
the spectroscopic period. However, the light curves do not exhibit a variation
at any frequency which is attributable to GW Lib type pulsations, to a
detection limit of 5 mmag. This non-detection is in contrast to previous
studies which have found three pulsation frequencies with amplitudes of 9 to 11
mmag at optical wavelengths. Destructive interference and changes to the
thermal properties of the driving layer in direct response to accretion can be
ruled out as causes of the non-detection. Alternatively, it is feasible that
the object has cooled out of the instability strip since a previous
(unobserved) dwarf nova superoutburst. This would be the first time this
behaviour has been seen in a cataclysmic variable pulsator. Another possibility
is that changes in the surface characteristics, possibly induced by accretion
phenomena, have modified the surface visibility of the pulsation modes. Further

Western economies 1881-2001. They examine four distinct periods in economic
history, and conclude that there is a secular trend towards greater

the standard economic literature on business cycle synchronisation, relies upon
the estimation of an empirical correlation matrix of time series data of
macroeconomic aggregates. However because of the small number of observations
and economies, the empirical correlation matrix may contain considerable noise.
Random matrix theory was developed to overcome this problem. I use random
matrix theory, and the associated technique of agglomerative hierarchical
clustering, to examine the evolution of business cycle synchronisation between
the capitalist economies in the long-run. Contrary to the findings of Bordo and
Helbing, it is not possible to speak of a 'secular trend' towards greater

indistinguishable from those which could be generated by a purely random

synchronisation, but it is very weak. In particular, the cycles of the major
economies cannot be said to be synchronised. Such synchronisation as exists in

three weeks with eleven telescopes, with almost continuous coverage for the
central ten days. This represents the most extensive campaign so far organized
on any solar-type oscillator. We describe in detail the methods we used for
processing and combining the data. These involved calculating weights for the
velocity time series from the measurement uncertainties and adjusting them in
order to minimize the noise level of the combined data. The time series of
velocities for Procyon shows the clear signature of oscillations, with a
plateau of excess power that is centred at 0.9 mHz and is broader than has been
seen for other stars. The mean amplitude of the radial modes is 38.1 +/- 1.3
cm/s (2.0 times solar), which is consistent with previous detections from the
ground and by the WIRE spacecraft, and also with the upper limit set by the
MOST spacecraft. The variation of the amplitude during the observing campaign
allows us to estimate the mode lifetime to be 1.5 d (+1.9/-0.8 d). We also find
a slow variation in the radial velocity of Procyon, with good agreement between
different telescopes. These variations are remarkably similar to those seen in
the Sun, and we interpret them as being due to rotational modulation from
active regions on the stellar surface. The variations appear to have a period
of about 10 days, which presumably equals the stellar rotation period or,
perhaps, half of it. The amount of power in these slow variations indicates

surface in a decaying active region by using a time series of the spatial
distribution of vector magnetic fields in the photosphere. The vector magnetic
fields are derived from full spectropolarimetric measurements with the Solar
Optical Telescope aboard Hinode. We compare a magnetic flux loss rate to a flux
transport rate in a decaying sunspot and its surrounding moat region. The
amount of magnetic flux that decreases in the sunspot and moat region is very
similar to magnetic flux transported to the outer boundary of the moat region.
The flux loss rates [$(dF/dt)_{loss}$] of magnetic elements with positive and
negative polarities are balanced each other around the outer boundary of the
moat region. These results suggest that most of the magnetic flux in the

complexity in a penalized goodness of fit measure. Asymptotic properties for
these types of procedures in settings like linear regression and ARMA time
series have been studied, but these do not naturally extend to nonstandard
situations such as mixed effects models, where simple definition of the sample
size is not meaningful. This paper introduces a new class of strategies, known
as fence methods, for mixed model selection, which includes linear and
generalized linear mixed models. The idea involves a procedure to isolate a
subgroup of what are known as correct models (of which the optimal model is a
member). This is accomplished by constructing a statistical fence, or barrier,
to carefully eliminate incorrect models. Once the fence is constructed, the
optimal model is selected from among those within the fence according to a
criterion which can be made flexible. In addition, we propose two variations of
the fence. The first is a stepwise procedure to handle situations of many

Asymptotic properties for\nthese types of procedures in settings like linear regression and ARMA time\nseries have been studied, but these do not naturally extend to nonstandard\nsituations such as mixed effects models, where simple definition of the sample\nsize is not meaningful. This paper introduces a new class of strategies, known\nas fence methods, for mixed model selection, which includes linear and\ngeneralized linear mixed models. The idea involves a procedure to isolate a\nsubgroup of what are known as correct models (of which the optimal model is a\nmember). This is accomplished by constructing a statistical fence, or barrier,\nto carefully eliminate incorrect models. Once the fence is constructed, the\noptimal model is selected from among those within the fence according to a\ncriterion which can be made flexible. In addition, we propose two variations of\nthe fence. The first is a stepwise procedure to handle situations of many\npredictors; the second is an adaptive approach for choosing a tuning constant.\nWe give sufficient conditions for consistency of fence and its variations, a\ndesirable property for a good model selection procedure.

sample of stars ranging from spectral type M0 to M8 aimed at investigating
observationally how dynamo processes operate in stars on both sides of the full
convection threshold (spectral type M4).
  The present paper focuses on early M stars (M0--M3), i.e. above the full
convection threshold. Applying tomographic imaging techniques to time series of
rotationally modulated circularly polarised profiles collected with the NARVAL
spectropolarimeter, we determine the rotation period and reconstruct the
large-scale magnetic topologies of 6 early M dwarfs. We find that early-M stars
preferentially host large-scale fields with dominantly toroidal and
non-axisymmetric poloidal configurations, along with significant differential
rotation (and long-term variability); only the lowest-mass star of our
subsample is found to host an almost fully poloidal, mainly axisymmetric
large-scale field ressembling those found in mid-M dwarfs.
  This abrupt change in the large-scale magnetic topologies of M dwarfs
(occuring at spectral type M3) has no related signature on X-ray luminosities
(measuring the total amount of magnetic flux); it thus suggests that underlying
dynamo processes become more efficient at producing large-scale fields (despite
producing the same flux) at spectral types later than M3. We suspect that this
change relates to the rapid decrease in the radiative cores of low-mass stars
and to the simultaneous sharp increase of the convective turnover times (with
decreasing stellar mass) that models predict to occur at M3; it may also be (at

resolution. LOFAR's Initial Test Station (LOFAR/ITS, The Netherlands) and the

the hopping amplitude vanishes for a certain walker density. Actually, we
evidence that, even if the density equals this pseudo-critical value, the
system does not present any criticality but only a dynamical slowing down. This
property is confirmed by the fact that, in spite of interaction, the particle
distribution at equilibrium is simply described in terms of a product of
Poissonians. For mesoscopic systems with a stationary flux, a very effect of
interaction among particles consists in the amplification of fluctuations,
which is especially relevant close to the pseudo-critical density. This agrees

opens a new era for studies of jet-dominated active galaxies, known as blazars.
While the emission processes operating in various spectral bands in blazars are
reasonably well understood, the knowledge of the details of the structure of
the jet, location of the dissipation region with respect to the accreting black
hole, and coupling of the jet to the accretion process are known only at a
rudimentary level. Blazars are variable, and this provides an opportunity to
use the variability in various bands - and in particular, the relationship of
respective time series to each other - to explore the relative location of
regions responsible for emission in the respective bands. Observationally, this
requires well-sampled time series in as many spectral bands as possible. To
this end, with its all-sky, sensitive monitoring capability, the recently
launched GLAST, and MAXI, to be deployed in 2009, are the most promising

of a 12 MHz (HF) Wellen Radar (WERA) off the West coast of France. The measured
currents, with tides filtered out, are of the order of 1.0 to 1.8% of the wind
speed, in a direction 10 to 40 degrees to the right of the wind. This
Lagrangian current can be decomposed as the vector sum of a quasi-Eulerian
current U_E, representative of the top 1 m of the water column, and a part of
the wave-induced Stokes drift Uss at the sea surface. Here Uss is estimated
with an accurate numerical wave model, thanks to a novel parameterization of
wave dissipation processes. Using both observed and modelled wave spectra, Uss

representing their correlations as time-dependent networks and investigating
the evolution of network communities. We employ a node-centric approach that
allows us to track the effects of the community evolution on the functional
roles of individual nodes without having to track entire communities. As an
example, we consider a foreign exchange market network in which each node
represents an exchange rate and each edge represents a time-dependent
correlation between the rates. We study the period 2005-2008, which includes
the recent credit and liquidity crisis. Using dynamical community detection, we
find that exchange rates that are strongly attached to their community are

with the 1-m Swedish Solar Telescope on La Palma. With the help of a multilevel

typical lifetime. Three quarters of the UDs lived for less than 150s and showed
no or little motion. The histogram of the UD diameters exhibits a maximum at
225km, i.e. most of the UDs are spatially resolved. UDs display a typical
horizontal velocity of 420m/s and a typical peak intensity of 51% of the mean

the local umbral background. Almost all mobile UDs (large birth-death distance)

variables were discovered, of which five are eclipsing binary candidates with
unequal minima. The remaining 133 periodic variables appear to consist mainly
of late-type stars whose variation is due to rotation modulated by star spot
activity. The determined periods range from less than a day to over 14 days and
have nearly unreddened B-R colors in the range of 0.8 to 2.8. The Barnes (2003)
interpretation of the period-color plane of late type stars is tested with our

field stars contaminating in the background, as we estimate the total
contamination to be 43%. Using different assumptions, the gyrochronological age
of the cluster is calculated to be 210+/-25 Myr, which falls in the range of
age values (164-250 Myr) determined by previous studies. Finally, we present

almost all of them focus on generating one graph based on one single static
source graph. On the other hand, Internet topology is evolving over time
continuously with the addition and deletion of nodes and edges. If a model is
based on all the topologies in the past, instead of one of them, it will be
more accurate and closer to the real world topology. In this paper, we study
the Internet As-level topology time-series from two different sources and find
that both of them obey four same dynamic graph patterns. Then we propose a mode
that can infer the topology in the future based on all the topologies in the

the Spitzer Space Telescope have yielded several direct detections of thermal
exoplanet light. Since Spitzer operates at wavelengths longward of 3.6 um,
arguably one of the most interesting parts of the planet spectrum (from 1 to 3
um) is inaccessible with this satellite. This region is at the peak of the
planet's spectral energy distribution and is also the regime where molecular
absorption bands can significantly influence the measured emission.
  Aims: So far, 2.2 um K-band secondary eclipse measurements, which are
possible from the ground, have not yet lead to secure detections. The aim of
this paper is to measure the secondary eclipse of the very hot Jupiter TrES-3b
in K-band, and in addition to observe its transit, to obtain an accurate planet
radius in the near infrared.
  Methods: We have used the William Herschell Telescope (WHT) to observe the
secondary eclipse, and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) to observe
the transit of TrES-3b. Both observations involved significant defocusing of
the telescope, aimed to produce high-cadence time series of several thousand
frames at high efficiency, with the starlight spread out over many pixels.

Since Spitzer operates at wavelengths longward of 3.6 um,\narguably one of the most interesting parts of the planet spectrum (from 1 to 3\num) is inaccessible with this satellite. This region is at the peak of the\nplanet's spectral energy distribution and is also the regime where molecular\nabsorption bands can significantly influence the measured emission.\n  Aims: So far, 2.2 um K-band secondary eclipse measurements, which are\npossible from the ground, have not yet lead to secure detections. The aim of\nthis paper is to measure the secondary eclipse of the very hot Jupiter TrES-3b\nin K-band, and in addition to observe its transit, to obtain an accurate planet\nradius in the near infrared.\n  Methods: We have used the William Herschell Telescope (WHT) to observe the\nsecondary eclipse, and the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT) to observe\nthe transit of TrES-3b. Both observations involved significant defocusing of\nthe telescope, aimed to produce high-cadence time series of several thousand\nframes at high efficiency, with the starlight spread out over many pixels.\n  Results: We detect the secondary eclipse of TrES-3b with a depth of\n-0.241+-0.043% (~6 sigma).

to causal discovery consists in fitting VAR models with an additional

is a critical task in epilepsy research. Characteristics of the pre-seizure
electroencephalograms (EEGs) such as oscillating powers and high-frequency
activities are believed to be indicative of the seizure onset and spread
patterns. In this article, we analyze epileptic EEG time series using
nonparametric spectral estimation methods to extract information on
seizure-specific power and characteristic frequency [or frequency band(s)].
Because the EEGs may become nonstationary before seizure events, we develop
methods for both stationary and local stationary processes. Based on penalized
Whittle likelihood, we propose a direct generalized maximum likelihood (GML)
and generalized approximate cross-validation (GACV) methods to estimate
smoothing parameters in both smoothing spline spectrum estimation of a
stationary process and smoothing spline ANOVA time-varying spectrum estimation
of a locally stationary process. We also propose permutation methods to test if
a locally stationary process is stationary. Extensive simulations indicate that
the proposed direct methods, especially the direct GML, are stable and perform

photosphere at the disk center obtained with the Solar Optical Telescope

\arcsec$\times$ 100 \arcsec, typically contain four supergranules. We monitor
in detail the motion and evolution of granules as well as those of the radial
magnetic field. Results: This analysis allows us to better characterize Trees

especially their lifetime statistics. Using floating corks advected by measured
velocity fields, we show their crucial role in the advection of the magnetic
field and in the build up of the network. Finally, thanks to the long duration

families contribute to the formation of the magnetic network and suggest that
supergranulation could be an emergent length scale building up as small

arranged along four distinct jet axes, we infer that the massive protostellar
source HW2 drives a pulsed, precessing jet that has changed its orientation by
about 45 degrees in roughly 104 years. The current HW2 radio jet represents the
most recent event in this time series of eruptions. This scenario is consistent
with the recent discovery of a disk around HW2, perpendicular to the current
jet orientation, and with the presence of companions at projected distances
comparable to the disk radius. We propose that the Cep A system formed by the
disk-assisted capture of a sibling star by HW2. We present a numerical model of
a 15 M_sun star with a circumstellar disk, orbited by a companion in an
inclined, eccentric orbit. Close passages of the companion through or near the
disk result in periods of enhanced accretion and mass loss, as well as forced
precession of the disk and associated orientation changes in the jet. The
observations reveal a second powerful outflow that emerges from radio source
HW3c or HW3d. This flow is associated with blueshifted CO emission and a faint
H2 bow shock to the east, and with HH 168 to the west. A collision between the

we employ the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA) on a subset of the MACHO database

transit searches, where weak, short-lasting periodic dimmings are sought in the
presence of noise and various systematics (due to, e.g., imperfect flat
fielding, crowding, etc). These latter effects introduce colored noise in the
photometric time series that can lead to a complete miss of the signal. By
using a large number of available photometric time series of a given field, TFA
utilizes the fact that the same types of systematics appear in several/many
time series of the same field. As a result, we fit each target time series by a
(least-square-sense) optimum linear combination of templates and
frequency-analyze the residuals. Once a signal is found, we reconstruct the
signal by employing the full model, including the signal, systematics and
noise. We apply TFA on the brightest ~5300 objects from subsets of each of the
MACHO Large Magellanic Cloud fields #1 and #79. We find that the Fourier
frequency analysis performed on the original data detect some 60% of the
objects as trend-dominated. This figure decreases essentially to zero after
using TFA. Altogether, We detect 387 variables in the two fields, 183 of which
would have remained undetected without using TFA. Where possible, we give
preliminary classification of the variables found.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Due to the strong effect of systematics/trends in variable star observations,\nwe employ the Trend Filtering Algorithm (TFA) on a subset of the MACHO database\nand search for variable stars.

We apply TFA on the brightest ~5300 objects from subsets of each of the\nMACHO Large Magellanic Cloud fields #1 and #79. We find that the Fourier\nfrequency analysis performed on the original data detect some 60% of the\nobjects as trend-dominated. This figure decreases essentially to zero after\nusing TFA.

stem from patterns of physical interactions unknown to us. To infer these
interactions, it is common to include edges between those nodes whose time
series exhibit sufficient functional connectivity, typically defined as a
measure of coupling exceeding a pre-determined threshold. However, when
uncertainty exists in the original network measurements, uncertainty in the
inferred network is likely, and hence a statistical propagation-of-error is
needed. In this manuscript, we describe a principled and systematic procedure
for the inference of functional connectivity networks from multivariate time
series data. Our procedure yields as output both the inferred network and a
quantification of uncertainty of the most fundamental interest: uncertainty in
the number of edges. To illustrate this approach, we apply our procedure to
simulated data and electrocorticogram data recorded from a human subject during

solar-type double-lined eclipsing binary star (V12) near the turnoff in the old
open cluster NGC188. We use these data to determine the spectroscopic orbit and
the photometric elements for V12. From our analysis we determine accurate
masses (Mp=1.103+-0.007Msun, Ms=1.081+-0.007Msun) and radii (R
=1.424+-0.019Rsun, Rs=1.373+-0.019Rsun) for the primary (p) and secondary (s)
binary components. We adopt a reddening of E_(B-V)=0.087 for NGC188, and derive
component effective temperatures of 5900+-100K and 5875+-100K, respectively,
for the primary and secondary stars. From their absolute dimensions, the two
components of V12 yield identical distance moduli of Vo-MV=11.24+-0.09,
corresponding to 1770+-75pc. We determine an age of 6.2+-0.2Gyr for V12 and
NGC188, from a comparison with theoretical isochrones in the mass-radius
diagram. This age is independent of distance, reddening, and color-temperature
transformations. We use isochrones from Victoria-Regina (VRSS) and Yonsei-Yale
(Y2) with [Fe/H]=-0.1 and [Fe/H]=0.0. From the solar metallicity isochrones, an
age of 6.4Gyr provides the best fit to the binary components for both sets of
models. For the isochrones with [Fe/H]=-0.1, ages of 6.0Gyr and 5.9Gyr provide
the best fits for the VRSS and Y2 models, respectively. We use the distance and
age estimates for V12, together with best estimates for the metallicity and
reddening of NGC188, to investigate the locations of the corresponding VRSS and
Y2 isochrones relative to cluster members in the color-magnitude diagram.

spectrum is to calculate the probability of obtaining that value or a larger

series contains only noise - typically that the measurements are derived from
random samplings of a Gaussian distribution. We really need to know the
probability that the time series is - or is not - compatible with the null
hypothesis that the measurements are derived from noise. This probability can
be calculated by Bayesian analysis, but this requires one to specify and
evaluate a second hypothesis, that the time series does contain a contribution
other than noise. We approach the problem of identifying this function in two
ways. We first propose three simple conditions that it seems reasonable to
impose on this function, and show that these conditions may be satisfied by a
simple function with one free parameter. We then define two different ways of
combining information derived from two independent power estimates. We find
that this consistency condition may be satisfied, to good approximation, by a
special case of the previously proposed likelihood function. We find that the
resulting significance estimates are considerably more conservative than those
usually associated with the p-values. As two examples, we apply the new

The intensity variations of\nthe Ca line core (z~1000 km) can be traced back to the velocity variations of\nthe lowermost forming spectral line considered (z~ 250 km). The chromospheric\nintensity, and hence, (radiation) temperature variations are seen to be induced\nby passing waves originating in the photosphere.'}","[{'name': 'C. Beck'}, {'name': 'E.

devoted to the multiplicity of O-type stars in the young open cluster NGC2244
and in the Mon OB2 association. Methods. Our spectroscopic monitoring was
performed over several years, allowing us to probe different time-scales. For
each star, several spectral diagnostic tools are applied, in order to search
for line shifts and profile variations. We also measure the projected
rotational velocity and revisit the spectral classification. Results. In our
sample, several stars were previously considered as spectroscopic binaries,
though only a few scattered observations were available. Our results now reveal
a more complex situation. Our study identifies two new spectroscopic binaries
(HD46149 in NGC2244 and HD46573 in MonOB2). The first object is a long-period
double-lined spectroscopic binary, though the exact value of its period remains
uncertain and the second object is classified as an SB1 system with a period of
about 10.67 days but the time series of our observations do not enable us to
derive a unique orbital solution for this system. We also classify another star
as variable in radial velocity (HD46150) and we detect line profile variations
in two rapid rotators (HD46056 and HD46485). Conclusions. This spectroscopic
investigation places a firm lower limit (17%) on the binary fraction of O-stars
in NGC2244 and reveals the lack of short-period O+OB systems in this cluster.
In addition, a comparison of these new results with two other well-studied
clusters (NGC6231 and IC1805) puts forward possible hints of a relation between
stellar density and binarity, which could provide constraints on the theories
about the formation and early evolution of hot stars.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=1000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Aims.

Convective collapse, a theoretically predicted process that intensifies
existing weak magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere, was first directly
observed in a single event by Nagata et al. (2008) using the high resolution
Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) of the Hinode satellite. Using the same space
telescope, we performed a statistical analysis of convective collapse events.
  Methods. Our data sets consist of high resolution time series of polarimetric
spectral scans of two iron lines formed in the lower photosphere and filter
images in Mg I b2 and Ca II H, spectral lines that are formed in the high
photosphere and the lower chromosphere, respectively. We were thus able to
study the implication of convective collapse events on the high photospheric
and the chromospheric layers. The physical parameters from the full Stokes
profiles were obtained with the MERLIN Milne-Eddington inversion code.
  Results. We found that in all cases, the event was accompanied by a continuum
bright point and nearly always by a brightening in the Ca II H images. The
magnesium dopplergram exhibits a strong downflow in about three quarters of the
events that took place within the field of view of the magnesium dopplergram.

reducing a great number of both sequential and random accesses. Impressively,

cluster (age 3 Myr) are studied based on NIR time series photometry supported
by MIR spectral energy distributions. We monitor ~30 young low-mass sources
over 8 nights in the J- and K-band using the duPont telescope at Las Campanas.
We find three objects showing variability with J-band amplitudes >0.5 mag; five
additional objects exhibit low-level variations. All three highly variable
sources have been previously identified as highly variable; thus we establish
the long-term nature of their flux changes. The lightcurves contain periodic
components with timescales of ~0.5-8 days, but have additional irregular
variations superimposed -- the characteristic behaviour for classical T Tauri
stars. Based on the colour variability, we conclude that hot spots are the
dominant cause of the variations in two objects, including one likely brown
dwarf, with spot temperatures in the range of 6000-7000 K. For the third one
(#2), a brown dwarf or very low mass star, inhomogenities at the inner edge of
the disk are the likely origin of the variability. Based on mid-infrared data
from Spitzer, we confirm that the three highly variable sources are surrounded
by circum-(sub)-stellar disks. They show typical SEDs for T Tauri-like objects.
Using SED models we infer an enhanced scaleheight in the disk for the object
#2, which favours the detection of disk inhomogenities in lightcurves and is
thus consistent with the information from variability. In the SOri cluster,
about every fifth accreting low-mass object shows persistent high-level

normal type Ia supernovae over a similar B-band decline rate and are broadly
consistent with the Phillips relation, although a mild dependence on viewing
angle is observed due to the asymmetry of the ejected debris. While event rates
within galactic centers and globular clusters are found to be much too low to

The CoRoT short runs give us the opportunity to observe a large
variety of late-type stars through their solar-like oscillations. We report
observations of the star HD175726 that lasted for 27 days during the first

the power spectrum presents an excess due to solar-like oscillations with a low
signal-to-noise ratio. Aims. Our aim is to identify the most efficient tools to
extract as much information as possible from the power density spectrum.
Methods. The most productive method appears to be the autocorrelation of the
time series, calculated as the spectrum of the filtered spectrum. This method
is efficient, very rapid computationally, and will be useful for the analysis
of other targets, observed with CoRoT or with forthcoming missions such as
Kepler and Plato. Results. The mean large separation has been measured to be
97.2+-0.5 microHz, slightly below the expected value determined from solar
scaling laws.We also show strong evidence for variation of the large separation

resistive, stable dead zone. The turbulent layers in turn drive motions in the
dead zone. We examine the properties of these motions using three-dimensional,
stratified, local, shearing-box, non-ideal, magnetohydrodynamical simulations.
Although the turbulence in the active zones provides a source of vorticity to
the midplane, no evidence for coherent vortices is found in our simulations. It
appears that this is because of strong vertical oscillations in the dead zone.
By analyzing time series of azimuthally-averaged flow quantities, we identify
an axisymmetric wave mode particular to models with dead zones. This mode is
reduced in amplitude, but not suppressed entirely, by changing the equation of
state from isothermal to ideal. These waves are too low-frequency to affect
sedimentation of dust to the midplane, but may have significance for the
