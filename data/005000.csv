of resting-state fMRI brain connectivity with a high temporal sensitivity.
Whereas most existing methods often rely on dividing the time-series into
larger segments of data (i.e. so called sliding window techniques), the
point-based method (PBM) proposed here provides an estimate of brain
connectivity at the level of individual sampled time-points. The achieved
increase in temporal sensitivity, together with temporal graph network theory
allowed us to study functional integration between, as well as within,
resting-state networks. Our results show that functional integrations between
two resting-state networks predominately occurs in bursts of activity with
intermittent periods of less connectivity, whereas the functional connectivity
within resting-state networks is characterized by a tonic/periodic connectivity
pattern. Moreover, the point-based approach allowed us to estimate the
persistency of brain connectivity, i.e. the duration of the intrinsic trace or
memory of resting-state connectivity patterns. The described point-based method
of dynamic resting-state functional connectivity allows for a detailed and
expanded view on the temporal dynamics of resting-state connectivity that
provides novel insights into how neuronal information processing is integrated
in the human brain at the level of large-scale networks.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'In this paper, we present a novel and versatile method to study the dynamics\nof resting-state fMRI brain connectivity with a high temporal sensitivity.\nWhereas most existing methods often rely on dividing the time-series into\nlarger segments of data (i.e. so called sliding window techniques), the\npoint-based method (PBM) proposed here provides an estimate of brain\nconnectivity at the level of individual sampled time-points.

extracts slowly varying features from a multi-dimensional time series. A
supervised extension to SFA for classification and regression is graph-based
SFA (GSFA). GSFA is based on the preservation of similarities, which are
specified by a graph structure derived from the labels. It has been shown that
hierarchical GSFA (HGSFA) allows learning from images and other
high-dimensional data. The feature space spanned by HGSFA is complex due to the
composition of the nonlinearities of the nodes in the network. However, we show
that the network discards useful information prematurely before it reaches
higher nodes, resulting in suboptimal global slowness and an under-exploited
feature space.
  To counteract these problems, we propose an extension called hierarchical
information-preserving GSFA (HiGSFA), where information preservation

of paramount importance for the characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres.

far-infrared, at wavelengths $>$3 $\mu$m, have been taken with Spitzer. In some
cases, in the past years, repeated observations and multiple reanalyses of the
same datasets led to discrepant results, raising questions about the accuracy
and reproducibility of such measurements. Morello et al. 2014, 2015 proposed a
blind-source separation method based on the Independent Component Analysis of
pixel time series (pixel-ICA) to analyze IRAC data, obtaining coherent results
when applied to repeated transit observations previously debated in the
literature. Here we introduce a variant to pixel-ICA through the use of wavelet
transform, wavelet pixel-ICA, which extends its applicability to low-S/N cases.

the exoplanet XO3b observed during the ""Warm Spitzer"" era in the 4.5 $\mu$m

Discussion will\nsuggest that this method can also be applied to other puzzles with the proper\ntransformations.""}",[{'name': 'Jared Weed'}],{'name': 'Jared Weed'},Jared Weed,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05744v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.05744v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'math.HO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'math.HO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.AI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,,

climate change attribution and research to assess the extent to which long-term
variations in the Sun's radiant energy incident on the Earth may exacerbate (or
mitigate) the more dominant warming in recent centuries due to increasing
concentrations of greenhouse gases. We investigate potential impacts of the new
Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) sunspot-number time
series on model reconstructions of TSI. In contemporary TSI records, variations
on time scales longer than about a day are dominated by the opposing effects of
sunspot darkening and facular brightening. These two surface magnetic features,
retrieved either from direct observations or from solar activity proxies, are
combined in TSI models to reproduce the current TSI observational record.
Indices that manifest solar-surface magnetic activity, in particular the
sunspot-number record, then enable the reconstruction of historical TSI.
Revisions to the sunspot-number record therefore affect the magnitude and
temporal structure of TSI variability on centennial time scales according to
the model reconstruction methodologies. We estimate the effects of the new
SILSO record on two widely used TSI reconstructions, namely the NRLTSI2 and the
SATIRE models. We find that the SILSO record has little effect on either model
after 1885 but leads to greater amplitude solar-cycle fluctuations in TSI
reconstructions prior, suggesting many 18th and 19th century cycles could be
similar in amplitude to those of the current Modern Maximum. TSI records based
on the revised sunspot data do not suggest a significant change in Maunder
Minimum TSI values, and comparing that era to the present we find only very
small potential differences in estimated solar contributions to climate with
this new sunspot record.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""Reliable historical records of total solar irradiance (TSI) are needed for\nclimate change attribution and research to assess the extent to which long-term\nvariations in the Sun's radiant energy incident on the Earth may exacerbate (or\nmitigate) the more dominant warming in recent centuries due to increasing\nconcentrations of greenhouse gases.

point beyond which a large sea-ice area disappears abruptly. The theory of
dynamical systems predicts a slowing down when a system destabilises towards a
tipping point. In simple stochastic systems this can result in increasing
variance and autocorrelation, potentially yielding an early warning of an
abrupt change. Here we aim to establish whether the loss of Arctic sea ice
would follow these conceptual predictions, and which trends in sea ice
variability can be expected from pre-industrial conditions toward an Arctic
that is ice-free during the whole year. To this end, we apply a model hierarchy
consisting of two box models and one comprehensive Earth system model. We find
a consistent and robust decrease of the ice volume's annual relaxation time
before summer ice is lost because thinner ice can adjust more quickly to
perturbations. Thereafter, the relaxation time increases, mainly because the
system becomes dominated by the ocean water's large heat capacity when the
ice-free season becomes longer. Both trends carry over to the autocorrelation
of sea ice thickness in time series. These changes are robust to the nature and
origin of climate variability in the models and hardly depend on the balance of
feedbacks. Therefore, characteristic trends can be expected in the future. As
these trends are not specific to the existence of abrupt ice loss, the
prospects for early warnings seem very limited. This result also has
implications for statistical indicators in other systems whose effective mass
changes over time, affecting the trend of their relaxation time. However, the
robust relation between state and variability would allow an estimate of
sea-ice variability from only short observations. This could help one to
estimate the likelihood and persistence of extreme events in the future.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""It has been widely debated whether Arctic sea-ice loss can reach a tipping\npoint beyond which a large sea-ice area disappears abruptly.

emitted by a more distant object such as a quasar. Strong gravitational lensing
causes multiple images of the same quasar to appear in the sky. Since the light
in each gravitationally lensed image traverses a different path length from the
quasar to the Earth, fluctuations in the source brightness are observed in the
several images at different times. The time delay between these fluctuations
can be used to constrain cosmological parameters and can be inferred from the
time series of brightness data or light curves of each image. To estimate the
time delay, we construct a model based on a state-space representation for
irregularly observed time series generated by a latent continuous-time
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. We account for microlensing, an additional source
of independent long-term extrinsic variability, via a polynomial regression.
Our Bayesian strategy adopts a Metropolis-Hastings within Gibbs sampler. We
improve the sampler by using an ancillarity-sufficiency interweaving strategy
and adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo. We introduce a profile likelihood of the
time delay as an approximation of its marginal posterior distribution. The
Bayesian and profile likelihood approaches complement each other, producing
almost identical results; the Bayesian method is more principled but the
profile likelihood is simpler to implement. We demonstrate our estimation

light and extending to $\sim463$ days after maximum, provide an unprecedented
time series of spectra and photometry for a normal SN~Ia. Fitting the
early-time rising light curve, we find that the luminosity evolution of SN
2011fe follows a $t^n$ law, with the index $n$ being close to 2.0 in the $VRI$
bands but slightly larger in the $U$ and $B$ bands. Combining the published
ultraviolet (UV) and near-infrared (NIR) photometry, we derive the contribution
of UV/NIR emission relative to the optical. SN 2011fe is found to have stronger
UV emission and reaches its UV peak a few days earlier than other SNe~Ia with
similar $\Delta m_{15}(B)$, suggestive of less trapping of high-energy photons
in the ejecta. Moreover, the $U$-band light curve shows a notably faster
decline at late phases ($t\approx 100$--300 days), which also suggests that the
ejecta may be relatively transparent to UV photons. These results favor the
notion that SN 2011fe might have a progenitor system with relatively lower
metallicity. On the other hand, the early-phase spectra exhibit prominent
high-velocity features (HVFs) of O~I $\lambda$7773 and the Ca~II~NIR triplet,

Branch (EHB) stars in omega Cen. The observations performed consist of nearly
100 hours of time-series photometry, as well as low-resolution spectroscopy. We
obtained photometry for some 300 EHB stars. Based on the spectroscopy, we
derive reliable values of log g, Teff and log(N(He)/N(H)) for 38 targets, as
well as estimates of the effective temperature for another nine targets. The
survey uncovered a total of five rapid variables with multi-periodic
oscillations between 85 and 125 s. Spectroscopically, they form a homogeneous
group of hydrogen-rich subdwarf O stars clustered between 48,000 and 54,000 K.
For each of the variables we are able to measure between two and three
significant pulsations believed to constitute independent harmonic
oscillations. In addition to the rapid variables, we found an EHB star with an
apparently periodic luminosity variation of ~2700 s, which we tentatively
suggest may be caused by ellipsoidal variations in a close binary. Using the
overlapping photometry and spectroscopy sample we are able to map an empirical
omega Cen instability strip. This can be directly compared to the pulsation
driving predicted from the Montreal ""second-generation"" models. We find that
the region where p-mode excitation occurs is bifurcated, and the well-known
instability strip between 29,000-36,000 K where the rapid subdwarf B pulsators
are found is complemented by a second one above 50,000 K. While significant
challenges remain at the quantitative level, we believe that the same

aid the quantification of isoforms across experiments. Numerical experiments on
simulated data sets show that DICEseq yields more accurate results than
state-of-the-art methods, an advantage that can become considerable at low
coverage levels. On real data sets, our results show that DICEseq provides
substan- tially more reproducible and robust quantifications, increasing the
correlation of estimates from replicate data sets by up to 10% on genes with

DICEseq permits to quantify the trade-off between temporal sampling of RNA and
depth of sequencing, frequently an important choice when planning experiments.

profile likelihood method for the calibration of nonlinear financial models
characterised by a large number of parameters. We apply the general approach to
the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model of financial bubbles. This
model is particularly relevant because one of its parameters, the critical time
$t_c$ signalling the burst of the bubble, is arguably the target of choice for
dynamical risk management. However, previous calibrations of the LPPLS model
have shown that the estimation of $t_c$ is in general quite unstable. Here, we
provide a rigorous likelihood inference approach to determine $t_c$, which
takes into account the impact of the other nonlinear (so-called ""nuisance"")
parameters for the correct adjustment of the uncertainty on $t_c$. This
provides a rigorous interval estimation for the critical time, rather than a
point estimation in previous approaches. As a bonus, the interval estimations
can also be obtained for the nuisance parameters ($m,\omega$, damping), which
can be used to improve filtering of the calibration results. We show that the
use of the modified profile likelihood method dramatically reduces the number
of local extrema by constructing much simpler smoother log-likelihood
landscapes. The remaining distinct solutions can be interpreted as genuine
scenarios that unfold as the time of the analysis flows, which can be compared
directly via their likelihood ratio. Finally, we develop a multi-scale profile

advantage was particularly apparent in the case of outliers in the series. When
tested on climatic time series, in most cases both methods detected the same

appeared to be spurious. As for the shorter time series (66-136 yearly values),
ICSS failed to detect any change points even when the variance doubled or

diseases in livestock populations. As a case study, we consider pig trade in
Germany, where trade actors (agricultural premises) form a complex network. The
central question is how infectious diseases can potentially spread within the
system of trade contacts. We address this question by analyzing the underlying
network of animal movements.
  Methodology/Findings: The considered pig trade dataset spans several years
and is analyzed with respect to its potential to spread infectious diseases.
Focusing on measurements of network-topological properties, we avoid the usage
of external parameters, since these properties are independent of specific
pathogens. They are on the contrary of great importance for understanding any
general spreading process on this particular network. We analyze the system
using different network models, which include varying amounts of information:
(i) static network, (ii) network as a time series of uncorrelated snapshots,
(iii) temporal network, where causality is explicitly taken into account.
  Findings: Our approach provides a general framework for a
topological-temporal characterization of livestock trade networks. We find that
a static network view captures many relevant aspects of the trade system, and
premises can be classified into two clearly defined risk classes. Moreover, our
results allow for an efficient allocation strategy for intervention measures
using centrality measures. Data on trade volume does barely alter the results
and is therefore of secondary importance. Although a static network description
yields useful results, the temporal resolution of data plays an outstanding
role for an in-depth understanding of spreading processes. This applies in

signals in data from the LIGO and Virgo detectors with a higher efficiency than
the time-domain Bayesian pipeline used in many previous searches. Our spectral
interpolation algorithm, SplInter, removes the intrinsic phase evolution of the
signal from source rotation and relative detector motion. We do this in the
frequency domain and generate a time series containing only variations in the
signal due to the antenna pattern. Although less flexible than the classic
heterodyne approach, SplInter allows for rapid analysis of putative signals
from isolated (and some binary) pulsars, and efficient follow-up searches for
candidate signals generated by other search methods. The computational saving

video streaming over the Internet. It allows clients to dynamically adapt media
characteristics to network conditions in order to ensure a high quality of
experience, that is, minimize playback interruptions, while maximizing video
quality at a reasonable level of quality changes. In the case of live
streaming, this task becomes particularly challenging due to the latency
constraints. The challenge further increases if a client uses a wireless
network, where the throughput is subject to considerable fluctuations.
Consequently, live streams often exhibit latencies of up to 30 seconds. In the
present work, we introduce an adaptation algorithm for HTTP-based live
streaming called LOLYPOP (Low-Latency Prediction-Based Adaptation) that is
designed to operate with a transport latency of few seconds. To reach this
goal, LOLYPOP leverages TCP throughput predictions on multiple time scales,
from 1 to 10 seconds, along with an estimate of the prediction error
distribution. In addition to satisfying the latency constraint, the algorithm
heuristically maximizes the quality of experience by maximizing the average
video quality as a function of the number of skipped segments and quality
transitions. In order to select an efficient prediction method, we studied the
performance of several time series prediction methods in IEEE 802.11 wireless
access networks. We evaluated LOLYPOP under a large set of experimental
conditions limiting the transport latency to 3 seconds, against a
state-of-the-art adaptation algorithm from the literature, called FESTIVE. We
observed that the average video quality is by up to a factor of 3 higher than
with FESTIVE. We also observed that LOLYPOP is able to reach a broader region

spanning finance, the physical sciences, and engineering. Much of the existing
literature in linear causal analysis operates in the time domain.
Unfortunately, the direct application of time domain linear causal analysis to
many real-world time series presents three critical challenges: irregular
temporal sampling, long range dependencies, and scale. Moreover, real-world
data is often collected at irregular time intervals across vast arrays of
decentralized sensors and with long range dependencies which make naive time
domain correlation estimators spurious. In this paper we present a frequency
domain based estimation framework which naturally handles irregularly sampled
data and long range dependencies while enabled memory and communication
efficient distributed processing of time series data. By operating in the
frequency domain we eliminate the need to interpolate and help mitigate the
effects of long range dependencies. We implement and evaluate our new work-flow
in the distributed setting using Apache Spark and demonstrate on both Monte

Much of the existing\nliterature in linear causal analysis operates in the time domain.\nUnfortunately, the direct application of time domain linear causal analysis to\nmany real-world time series presents three critical challenges: irregular\ntemporal sampling, long range dependencies, and scale. Moreover, real-world\ndata is often collected at irregular time intervals across vast arrays of\ndecentralized sensors and with long range dependencies which make naive time\ndomain correlation estimators spurious. In this paper we present a frequency\ndomain based estimation framework which naturally handles irregularly sampled\ndata and long range dependencies while enabled memory and communication\nefficient distributed processing of time series data. By operating in the\nfrequency domain we eliminate the need to interpolate and help mitigate the\neffects of long range dependencies.

increasingly important. Measurements within and across brain structures,
demonstrating the occurrence of bursts of beta/gamma oscillations only during
one specific phase of each theta/alpha cycle, have motivated the need to
advance beyond linear and stationary time series models. Here we offer a novel
measure, namely, the ""dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient"", for assessing
different types of frequency-frequency interactions that subserve information
flow in the brain. This is a measure of coherence between two complex-valued
vectors, consisting of the set of Fourier coefficients for two different
frequency bands, within or across two brain regions. RV-coupling is expressed
in terms of instantaneous and lagged components. Furthermore, by using
normalized Fourier coefficients (unit modulus), phase-type couplings can also
be measured. The dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient is based on previous
work: the second order bispectrum, i.e. the dual-frequency coherence (Thomson
1982; Haykin & Thomson 1998); the RV-coefficient (Escoufier 1973); Gorrostieta
et al (2012); and Pascual-Marqui et al (2011). This paper presents the new
measure, and outlines relevant statistical tests. The novel aspects of the
""dual frequency RV-coupling coefficient"" are: (1) it can be applied to two
multivariate time series; (2) the method is not limited to single discrete
frequencies, and in addition, the frequency bands are treated by means of
appropriate multivariate statistical methodology; (3) the method makes use of a
novel generalization of the RV-coefficient for complex-valued multivariate
data; (4) real and imaginary covariance contributions to the RV-coherence are
obtained, allowing the definition of a ""lagged-coupling"" measure that is
minimally affected by the low spatial resolution of estimated cortical electric
neuronal activity.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Identifying dynamic transactions between brain regions has become\nincreasingly important.

Considering the nearly edge-on geometry of the disk, the inner\nrim should be 0.084 AU from the protostar on average, with an error of order\n0.01 AU. This size is likely larger than the range of magnetospheric\ntruncations, and consistent with an optically and geometrically thick disk\nfront at the dust sublimation radius at ~1500 K. The widths of the\ncross-correlation functions between the data in different wavebands place\npossible new constraints on the geometry of the disk.'}","[{'name': 'Huan Y. A.

obscure emission physics and geometry of the prompt emission of GRBs. Fourier
power density spectra (PDS) characterise time series as stochastic processes
and can be used to search for coherent pulsations and to investigate the
dominant variability timescales. Because of the limited duration and of the
statistical properties, modelling the PDS of individual GRBs is challenging,
and only average PDS of large samples have been discussed in the literature. We
characterise the individual PDS of GRBs in terms of a stochastic process, and
carry out for the first time a systematic search for periodic signals and for a
link between the PDS and other observables. We present a Bayesian procedure
that uses a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique and apply it to study 215 bright
long GRBs detected with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope from January 2005 to
May 2015. The PDS are modelled with a power-law either with or without a break.
Two classes of GRBs emerge: with or without a unique dominant timescale. A

time series, has been around for decades within the community of data mining
and machine learning, and found many important applications such as biomedical
engineering and clinical prediction. However, it still remains challenging and
falls short of classification accuracy and efficiency. Traditional approaches
typically involve extracting discriminative features from the original time
series using dynamic time warping (DTW) or shapelet transformation, based on
which an off-the-shelf classifier can be applied. These methods are ad-hoc and
separate the feature extraction part with the classification part, which limits

investigated until very recently, when we proposed using the innovative
methodology of {\em gray-box prediction}. This methodology advocates the use of
gray-box models, which accommodate the statistical properties/phenomena
exhibited by the data. Specifically, we showed that gray-box models that
accommodate the Long-Range Dependence (LRD) phenomenon can predict the attack
rate (i.e., the number of attacks per unit time) 1-hour ahead-of-time with an
accuracy of 70.2-82.1\%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result
showing the feasibility of prediction in this domain. We observe that the
prediction errors are partly caused by the models' incapability in predicting
the large attack rates, which are called {\em extreme values} in statistics.

complementary approaches: the Extreme Value Theory (EVT) and the Time Series
Theory (TST). In this paper, we show that EVT can offer long-term predictions

of three kinds of time series: the number of victims (i.e., telescope IP
addresses that are attacked), the number of attackers that are observed by the
telescope, and the number of attacks that are observed by the telescope.
Characterizing cybersecurity posture therefore becomes investigating the
phenomena and statistical properties exhibited by these time series, and
explaining their cybersecurity meanings. For example, we propose the concept of
{\em sweep-time}, and show that sweep-time should be modeled by stochastic
process, rather than random variable. We report that the number of attackers

the strongest interfering transmitters, a first-order solution for relative

observed a transit of the inflated Hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b with MODS at the LBT
to characterize its atmosphere from 3300 to 10000 AA. A time series of target
and reference star spectra was binned in two broad-band wavelength channels,
from which differential transit light curves were constructed. These broad-band
light curves were used to confirm previous transit parameter determinations. To
derive the planetary transmission spectrum with a resolution of R ~ 60, we
created a chromatic set of 62 narrow-band light curves with an average
wavelength width of about 100 AA. The spectrum was corrected for the
third-light of a near-by M star, whose spectrum was resolved in the individual
exposures. Additionally, we undertook a photometric monitoring campaign of the
host star to correct for the influence of starspots. The transmission spectrum
of HAT-P-32b shows no pressure-broadened absorption features from Na and K,
which is interpreted by the presence of clouds or hazes in the planetary
atmosphere. This result is in agreement to previous studies on the same planet.
The presence of TiO in gas phase could be ruled out. We find a 2.8 sigma
indication of increased absorption in the line core of potassium (KI~7699 AA).
No narrow absorption features of Na and Halpha were detected. Furthermore,
tentative indications were found for a slope of increasing opacity toward blue
wavelengths from the near-IR to the near-UV with an amplitude of two scale

features from biological sequences and time series. It reflects the inner
information structure of the sequences. A fractional period is not uncommon in
time series. A typical example is the 3.6 period in protein sequences, which
determines the $\alpha$-helix secondary structure. Computing the spectrum of a
fractional period offers a high-resolution insight into a time series. It has
thus become an important approach in genomic analysis. However, computing
Fourier spectra of fractional periods by the traditional Fourier transform is
computationally expensive. In this paper, we present a novel, fast algorithm
for directly computing the fractional period spectrum (FPS) of time series. The
algorithm is based on the periodic distribution of signal strength at periodic
positions of the time series. We provide theoretical analysis, deduction, and
special techniques for reducing the computational costs of the algorithm. The
analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm shows that the
algorithm is much faster than traditional Fourier transform. Our algorithm can
be applied directly in computing fractional periods in time series from a broad

Computing the spectrum of a\nfractional period offers a high-resolution insight into a time series. It has\nthus become an important approach in genomic analysis. However, computing\nFourier spectra of fractional periods by the traditional Fourier transform is\ncomputationally expensive.

The\nalgorithm is based on the periodic distribution of signal strength at periodic\npositions of the time series. We provide theoretical analysis, deduction, and\nspecial techniques for reducing the computational costs of the algorithm. The\nanalysis of the computational complexity of the algorithm shows that the\nalgorithm is much faster than traditional Fourier transform.

palaeoclimate sensitivity estimates with estimates from model simulations. In
addition, information from the late Pleistocene ice age cycles indicates that
the climate cycles between cold and warm regimes, and the climate sensitivity
varies considerably between regime because of fast feedback processes changing
relative strength and time scales over one cycle.

the value of a stock from a given maximum price level. A critical level in the
amount of price declines is found to separate a segment operating under a
random walk from a segment operating under a power law. This level is
interpreted as a point of phase transition into a self-organized system.
Evidence of self-organization was found in all the stock market indices studied
but in none of the control synthetic random series. Findings partially explain
the fractal structure characteristic of financial time series and suggest that
price fluctuations adopt two different operating regimes. We propose to

orbiting GJ 725B, our observations reveal changes in the spectral energy
distribution (SED) correlated with measurements of the width of the
instrumental line profile and, to a lower degree, with the Doppler
measurements. To study the origin of these effects, we searched for
correlations among several quantities defined and measured on the spectra and
on the acquisition images.
  We find that the changes in apparent SED are very likely related to flux
losses at the fibre input. Further tests indicate that such flux losses do not
seriously affect the shape of the instrumental point spread function of
HARPS-N, but identify an inefficient fitting of the continuum as the most
likely source of the systematic variability observed in the FWHM. This index,
accounting for the HARPS-N cross-correlation profiles width, is often used to
decorrelate Doppler time-series. We show that the Doppler measurement obtained
by a parametric least-squares fitting of the spectrum accounting for continuum
variability is insensitive to changes in the slope of the SED, suggesting that
forward modeling techniques to measure moments of the line profile are the
optimal way to achieve higher accuracy. Remaining residual variability at ~1
m/s suggests that for M-stars Doppler surveys the current noise floor still has
an instrumental origin.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Understanding the sources of instrumental systematic noise is a must to\nimprove the design of future spectrographs.

IV. Confirmation of the\n  flat transmission spectrum of HAT-P-32b'}","We observed the hot Jupiter HAT-P-32b (also known as HAT-P-32Ab) to determine
its optical transmission spectrum by measuring the wavelength-dependent
planet-to-star radius ratios in the region between 518 - 918 nm. We used the
OSIRIS instrument at the GTC in long slit spectroscopy mode, placing HAT-P-32
and a reference star in the same slit and obtaining a time series of spectra
covering two transit events. Using the best quality data set, we were able to
yield 20 narrow-band transit light curves, with each passband spanning a 20 nm
wide interval. After removal of all systematic noise signals and light curve
modeling the uncertainties for the resulting radius ratios lie between 337 and
972 ppm. The radius ratios show little variation with wavelength suggesting a
high altitude cloud layer masking any atmospheric features. Alternatively, a
strong depletion in alkali metals or a much smaller than expected planetary
atmospheric scale height could be responsible for the lack of atmospheric
features. Our result of a flat transmission spectrum is consistent with a
previous ground-based study of the optical spectrum of this planet. This
agreement between independent results demonstrates that ground-based
measurements of exoplanet atmospheres can give reliable and reproducible
results despite the fact that the data often is heavily affected by systematic
noise, as long as the noise source is well understood and properly corrected.
We also extract an optical spectrum of the M-dwarf companion HAT-P-32B. Using

Using the best quality data set, we were able to\nyield 20 narrow-band transit light curves, with each passband spanning a 20 nm\nwide interval. After removal of all systematic noise signals and light curve\nmodeling the uncertainties for the resulting radius ratios lie between 337 and\n972 ppm. The radius ratios show little variation with wavelength suggesting a\nhigh altitude cloud layer masking any atmospheric features. Alternatively, a\nstrong depletion in alkali metals or a much smaller than expected planetary\natmospheric scale height could be responsible for the lack of atmospheric\nfeatures. Our result of a flat transmission spectrum is consistent with a\nprevious ground-based study of the optical spectrum of this planet. This\nagreement between independent results demonstrates that ground-based\nmeasurements of exoplanet atmospheres can give reliable and reproducible\nresults despite the fact that the data often is heavily affected by systematic\nnoise, as long as the noise source is well understood and properly corrected.\nWe also extract an optical spectrum of the M-dwarf companion HAT-P-32B.

Based on this convergence we can also\nderive the limit laws of various function als of the ordered eigenvalues such\nas the joint convergence of a finite number of the largest order statistics,\nthe joint limit law of the largest eigenvalue and the trace, limit laws for\nsuccessive ratios of ordered eigenvalues, etc. We also develop some limit\ntheory for the singular values of the sample autocovariance matrices and their\nsums of squares.

Experiments demonstrate that ODE-augmented\ntraining data allows better coverage of possible control input(s) and results\nin learning more accurate distinctions between normal and anomalous behaviour\nin time-series.'}","[{'name': 'Mohit Yadav'}, {'name': 'Pankaj Malhotra'}, {'name': 'Lovekesh Vig'}, {'name': 'K Sriram'}, {'name': 'Gautam Shroff'}]",{'name': 'Gautam Shroff'},Gautam Shroff,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01534v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.01534v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.AI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.AI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,Published at NIPS Time-series Workshop - 2015,,

series which resolve the profiles of absorption lines such as Na I D or Ca II

predicted to occur during the early phases of SNe Ia, when the supernova peaks

variations by obtaining high-resolution spectra of SNe before maximum light. We
have obtained photometry and high-resolution spectroscopy of SNe Ia 2013gh and

series suffer often from aperiodic non-stationarity, presence of ectopic beats
etc. It would be hard to extract helpful information from the original signals.
10 $\bullet$ Problem : Trend removal methods are commonly practiced to reduce
the influence of the low frequency and aperiodic non-stationary in RR data.
This can unfortunately affect the signal and make the analysis on detrended
data less appropriate. $\bullet$ Objective : Investigate the detrending effect
(linear \& nonlinear) in temporal / nonliear analysis of heart rate variability
of long-term RR data (in normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, 15
congestive heart failure and ventricular premature arrhythmia conditions).
$\bullet$ Methods : Temporal method : standard measure SDNN; Nonlinear methods
: multi-scale Fractal Dimension (FD), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) \&
Sample Entropy (Sam-pEn) analysis. $\bullet$ Results : The linear detrending
affects little the global characteristics of the RR data, either 20 in temporal
analysis or in nonlinear complexity analysis. After linear detrending, the
SDNNs are just slightly shifted and all distributions are well preserved. The
cross-scale complexity remained almost the same as the ones for original RR
data or correlated. Nonlinear detrending changed not only the SDNNs
distribution, but also the order among different types of RR data. After this
processing, the SDNN became indistinguishable be-25 tween SDNN for normal sinus
rhythm and ventricular premature beats. Different RR data has different
complexity signature. Nonlinear detrending made the all RR data to be similar ,
in terms of complexity. It is thus impossible to distinguish them. The FD
showed that nonlinearly detrended RR data has a dimension close to 2, the
exponent from DFA is close to zero and SampEn is larger than 1.5 -- these
complexity values are very close to those for 30 random signal. $\bullet$
Conclusions : Pre-processing by linear detrending can be performed on RR data,
which has little influence on the corresponding analysis. Nonlinear detrending
could be harmful and it is not advisable to use this type of pre-processing.

avoid complete change of the signal's intrinsic dynamics. 35 Keywords $\bullet$

transcript isoforms. Alternative splicing is involved in the regulation of

consistent changes in alternative splicing independent of changes in absolute

manifestations of solar eruptions. The overtaken solar wind forms a sheath of
compressed plasma at the front of ICMEs. Magnetic clouds (MCs) are a subset of
ICMEs with specific properties (e.g. the presence of a flux rope). When ICMEs
pass near Earth, ground observations indicate that the flux of galactic cosmic
rays (GCRs) decreases. The main aims of this paper are to find: common plasma
and magnetic properties of different ICME sub-structures, and which ICME
properties affect the flux of GCRs near Earth. We use a superposed epoch method
applied to a large set of ICMEs observed \insitu\ by the spacecraft ACE,
between 1998 and 2006. We also apply a superposed epoch analysis on GCRs time
series observed with the McMurdo neutron monitors. We find that slow MCs at 1
AU have on average more massive sheaths. We conclude that it is because they
are more effectively slowed down by drag during their travel from the Sun. Slow
MCs also have a more symmetric magnetic field and sheaths expanding similarly
as their following MC, while in contrast, fast MCs have an asymmetric magnetic
profile and a compressing sheath in compression. In all types of MCs, we find
that the proton density and the temperature, as well as the magnetic
fluctuations can diffuse within the front of the MC due to 3D reconnection.
Finally, we derive a quantitative model which describes the decrease of cosmic
rays as a function of the amount of magnetic fluctuations and field strength.
The obtained typical profiles of sheath/MC/GCR properties corresponding to
slow, mid, and fast ICMEs, can be used for forecasting/modelling these events,
and to better understand the transport of energetic particles in ICMEs. They
are also useful for improving future operative space weather activities.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs) are the interplanetary\nmanifestations of solar eruptions.

possible local non-linear distortions, and has been widely applied to audio,
video and graphics data alignments. DTW is essentially a point-to-point
matching method under some boundary and temporal consistency constraints.
Although DTW obtains a global optimal solution, it does not necessarily achieve
locally sensible matchings. Concretely, two temporal points with entirely
dissimilar local structures may be matched by DTW. To address this problem, we
propose an improved alignment algorithm, named shape Dynamic Time Warping
(shapeDTW), which enhances DTW by taking point-wise local structural
information into consideration. shapeDTW is inherently a DTW algorithm, but
additionally attempts to pair locally similar structures and to avoid matching
points with distinct neighborhood structures. We apply shapeDTW to align audio
signal pairs having ground-truth alignments, as well as artificially simulated
pairs of aligned sequences, and obtain quantitatively much lower alignment
errors than DTW and its two variants. When shapeDTW is used as a distance
measure in a nearest neighbor classifier (NN-shapeDTW) to classify time series,
it beats DTW on 64 out of 84 UCR time series datasets, with significantly
improved classification accuracies. By using a properly designed local
structure descriptor, shapeDTW improves accuracies by more than 10% on 18
datasets. To the best of our knowledge, shapeDTW is the first distance measure

DTW is essentially a point-to-point\nmatching method under some boundary and temporal consistency constraints.\nAlthough DTW obtains a global optimal solution, it does not necessarily achieve\nlocally sensible matchings. Concretely, two temporal points with entirely\ndissimilar local structures may be matched by DTW. To address this problem, we\npropose an improved alignment algorithm, named shape Dynamic Time Warping\n(shapeDTW), which enhances DTW by taking point-wise local structural\ninformation into consideration. shapeDTW is inherently a DTW algorithm, but\nadditionally attempts to pair locally similar structures and to avoid matching\npoints with distinct neighborhood structures. We apply shapeDTW to align audio\nsignal pairs having ground-truth alignments, as well as artificially simulated\npairs of aligned sequences, and obtain quantitatively much lower alignment\nerrors than DTW and its two variants. When shapeDTW is used as a distance\nmeasure in a nearest neighbor classifier (NN-shapeDTW) to classify time series,\nit beats DTW on 64 out of 84 UCR time series datasets, with significantly\nimproved classification accuracies. By using a properly designed local\nstructure descriptor, shapeDTW improves accuracies by more than 10% on 18\ndatasets.

factor making it difficult to detect TEC anomalies is large noises in TEC data.
Non-negligible TEC disturbances are caused by many natural mechanisms. To
overcome this difficulty, we propose correlation analyses between one GNSS

a few hours using polynomial functions of time. Second, we calculate prediction
errors as the departure of the TEC time series from the models over time scale
of a few minutes, and define it as the TEC anomaly. Third, we calculate the
correlation between anomaly of one GNSS station and those at the surrounding
stations. Although such a correlation method has long been used for radio
communications, in particular for spread spectrum communications and very long
baseline interferometry (VLBI) to increase SNR (signal to noise ratio), it has

standard practice in analysing fMRI data. Although decoding methods have been
extensively applied in Brain Computing Interfaces (BCI), these methods have
only recently been applied to time-series neuroimaging data such as MEG and EEG
to address experimental questions in Cognitive Neuroscience. In a
tutorial-style review, we describe a broad set of options to inform future
time-series decoding studies from a Cognitive Neuroscience perspective. Using
example MEG data, we illustrate the effects that different options in the
decoding analysis pipeline can have on experimental results where the aim is to
'decode' different perceptual stimuli or cognitive states over time from
dynamic brain activation patterns. We show that decisions made at both
preprocessing (e.g., dimensionality reduction, subsampling, trial averaging)
and decoding (e.g., classifier selection, cross-validation design) stages of

proper identification of the frequency dependence and statistical properties of

the common practice of data detrending, which tends to produce spurious
detections around the cut-off frequency of the filter. In addition, the white
and red noise models built into the widely used wavelet code of Torrence &
Compo cannot, in most cases, adequately represent the power spectra of coronal
time series, thus also possibly causing false positives. Both effects suggest
that several reports of periodic phenomena should be re-examined. The Torrence
& Compo code nonetheless effectively computes rigorous confidence levels if
provided with pertinent models of mean power spectra, and we describe the
appropriate manner in which to call its core routines. We recall the meaning of
the default confidence levels output from the code, and we propose new
Monte-Carlo-derived levels that take into account the total number of degrees

series. However, in related literature where methods for solving the cascade
prediction problem were proposed, the experimental settings were often limited
to only a single metric for a specific problem formulation. Moreover, little
attention was paid to the run time of those methods. In this paper, we first
formulate the cascade prediction problem as both classification and regression.
Then we compare three categories of cascade prediction methods: centrality
based, feature based and point process based. We carry out the comparison
through evaluation of the methods by both accuracy metrics and run time. The
results show that feature based methods can outperform others in terms of
prediction accuracy but suffer from heavy overhead especially for large
datasets. While point process based methods can also run into issue of long run

As a\ncascade can be considered as compound of the social network and the time\nseries. However, in related literature where methods for solving the cascade\nprediction problem were proposed, the experimental settings were often limited\nto only a single metric for a specific problem formulation. Moreover, little\nattention was paid to the run time of those methods. In this paper, we first\nformulate the cascade prediction problem as both classification and regression.\nThen we compare three categories of cascade prediction methods: centrality\nbased, feature based and point process based. We carry out the comparison\nthrough evaluation of the methods by both accuracy metrics and run time. The\nresults show that feature based methods can outperform others in terms of\nprediction accuracy but suffer from heavy overhead especially for large\ndatasets. While point process based methods can also run into issue of long run\ntime when the model can not well adapt to the data. This paper seeks to address\nissues in order to allow developers of systems for social network analysis to\nselect the most appropriate method for predicting viral information cascades.'}","[{'name': 'Ruocheng Guo'}, {'name': 'Paulo Shakarian'}]",{'name': 'Paulo Shakarian'},Paulo Shakarian,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05730v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.05730v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.SI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.SI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,"8 pages, 29 figures, ASONAM 2016 (Industry Track)",,

obtained with three different telescopes (UVES/VLT, HARPS/ESO 3.6m &
HARPS-N/TNG) were analysed. Targeting the sodium D lines and the calcium H and
K lines, the potential planet exospheric signal was filtered out from the much
stronger stellar and telluric signals, making use of the change of the radial
component of the orbital velocity of the planet over the transit from -57 to
+57 km/sec. Combining all five transit data sets, we detect a signal
potentially associated with sodium in the planet exosphere at a statistical
significance level of 3$\sigma$. Combining the four HARPS transits that cover
the calcium H and K lines, we also find a potential signal from ionized calcium
(4.1 $\sigma$). Interestingly, this latter signal originates from just one of
the transit measurements - with a 4.9$\sigma$ detection at this epoch.
Unfortunately, due to the low significance of the measured sodium signal and
the potentially variable Ca$^+$ signal, we estimate the p-values of these
signals to be too high (corresponding to <4$\sigma$) to claim unambiguous
exospheric detections. By comparing the observed signals with artificial
signals injected early in the analysis, the absorption by Na and Ca$^+$ are
estimated to be at a level of approximately 2.3$\times 10^{-3}$ and 7.0$\times

identified from a 37-minute time series of IRIS 1400 A slitjaw images. Their
locations tend to be associated more with downflowing and darker fibrils in the
chromosphere, and weakly associated with bright penumbral features in the
photosphere. However, temporal evolution analyses of the BDs show that there is
no consistent and convincing brightening response in the chromosphere. These
results are compatible with a formation mechanism of the TR penumbral BDs by
falling plasma from coronal heights along more vertical and dense magnetic

The
measure is based on a statistical analysis of simulated forecasts of wave
heights outside an impact site and how much the forecasts are degraded in
accuracy when one or more buoys are inoperative. The analysis uses simulated
tsunami height time series collected at each buoy from selected source segments
in the Short-term Inundation Forecast for Tsunamis (SIFT) database and involves
a set for 1000 forecasts for each buoy/segment pair at sites just offshore of
selected impact communities. Random error-producing scatter in the time series
is induced by uncertainties in the source location, addition of real oceanic
noise, and imperfect tidal removal. Comparison with an error-free standard
leads to root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) for DART buoys located near a
subduction zone. The RMSEs indicate which buoy provides the best forecast
(lowest RMSE) for sections of the zone, under a warning-time constraint for the
forecasts of 3 hrs. The analysis also shows how the forecasts are degraded
(larger minimum RMSE among the remaining buoys) when one or more buoys become
inoperative. The RMSEs also provide a way to assess array augmentation or
redesign such as moving buoys to more optimal locations. Examples are shown for
buoys off the Aleutian Islands and off the West Coast of South America for
impact sites at Hilo HI and along the U.S. West Coast (Crescent City CA and

Networks (HMMNs), which establishes a set of brain networks at multiple time
resolutions of fMRI signal to represent the underlying cognitive process. The
suggested framework, first, decomposes the fMRI signal into various frequency
subbands using wavelet transforms. Then, a brain network, called mesh network,
is formed at each subband by ensembling a set of local meshes. The locality
around each anatomic region is defined with respect to a neighborhood system
based on functional connectivity. The arc weights of a mesh are estimated by
ridge regression formed among the average region time series. In the final
step, the adjacency matrices of mesh networks obtained at different subbands
are ensembled for brain decoding under a hierarchical learning architecture,
called, fuzzy stacked generalization (FSG). Our results on Human Connectome
Project task-fMRI dataset reflect that the suggested HMMN model can
successfully discriminate tasks by extracting complementary information

spurious connections, detected either by time domain GC or by DTF. Therefore,
GC/DTF causal connectivity measures should be computed at the source level, or

We next consider a full time-dependent tomographic\nreconstruction involving spatio-temporal regularization and further introduce a\nco-rotating regularization aimed at preventing concentration of reconstructed\ndensity in the plane of the sky. Crucial to testing our procedure and properly\ntuning the regularization parameters is the introduction of a time-dependent\nMHD model of the corona based on observed magnetograms to build a time-series\nof synthetic images of the corona. Our procedure, which successfully reproduces\nthe time-varying model corona, is finally applied to a set of of 53 LASCO-C2 pB\nimages roughly evenly spaced in time from 15 to 29 March 2009. Our procedure\npaves the way to a time-dependent tomographic reconstruction of the coronal\nelectron density to the whole set of LASCO-C2 images presently spanning 20\nyears.'}","[{'name': 'Didier Vibert'}, {'name': 'Christelle Peillon'}, {'name': 'Philippe Lamy'}, {'name': 'Richard A.

disturbance in the disk's radial and/or vertical structure. Using time-series
photometric observations by the Kilodegree Extremely Little Telescope South
(KELT-South) project and the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN),
combined with archival observations, we present the discovery of two extended
dimming events of the young star, DM Ori. This young system faded by $\sim$1.5

separated by $\sim$12.5 years. A model of the spectral energy distribution
(SED) indicates a large infrared excess consistent with an extensive
circumstellar disk. Using basic kinematic arguments, we propose that DM Ori is
likely being periodically occulted by a feature (possibly a warp or
perturbation) in its circumstellar disk. In this scenario, the occulting
feature is located $>$6 AU from the host star, moving at $\sim$14.6 km/s, and

A model of the spectral energy distribution\n(SED) indicates a large infrared excess consistent with an extensive\ncircumstellar disk. Using basic kinematic arguments, we propose that DM Ori is\nlikely being periodically occulted by a feature (possibly a warp or\nperturbation) in its circumstellar disk.

rises when approaching the peripheral sites to compensate the rise of the

Are there any
differences between how the clock reacts when exposed to different
concentrations of elements of the periodic table? If so, can we characterise
these differences?
  We approach these questions by analysing and modelling circadian plant data,
where the levels of expression of a luciferase reporter gene were measured at
regular intervals over a number of days after exposure to different
concentrations of lithium.
  A key aspect of circadian data analysis is to determine whether a time series
(derived from experimental data) is `rhythmic' and, if so, to determine the
underlying period. However, our dataset displays nonstationary traits such as
changes in amplitude, gradual changes in period and phase-shifts.
  In this paper, we develop clustering methods using a wavelet transform.
Wavelets are chosen as they are ideally suited to identifying discriminant
local time and scale features. Furthermore, we propose treating the observed
time series as realisations of locally stationary wavelet processes. This
allows us to define and estimate the evolutionary wavelet spectrum. We can then
compare, in a quantitative way, using a functional principal components
analysis, the time-frequency patterns of the time series. Our approach uses a
clustering algorithm to group the data according to their time-frequency
patterns. We demonstrate the advantages of our methodology over alternative
approaches and show that it successfully clusters our data.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""How does soil pollution affect a plant's circadian clock?

class and examine whether the radio variability is related to the gamma-ray
loudness. Finally, we assess the validity of a putative correlation between the

twelve radio frequencies between 2.64 and 228.39 GHz. We perform a time series

maximum likelihood analysis is used to assess the significance of a correlation

telescopes. All sources are variable across all frequency bands with amplitudes
increasing with frequency up to rest frame frequencies of around 60 - 80 GHz as
expected by shock-in-jet models. Compared to FSRQs, BL Lacs show systematically
lower variability amplitudes, brightness temperatures and Doppler factors at
lower frequencies, while the difference vanishes towards higher ones. The time
scales appear similar for the two classes. The distribution of spectral indices
appears flatter or more inverted at higher frequencies for BL Lacs. Evolving
synchrotron self-absorbed components can naturally account for the observed

hierarchical prior overcomes overparametrization and overfitting issues by
clustering the VAR coefficients into groups and by shrinking the coefficients

induced by the BNP-Lasso prior are well suited for the extraction of causal

measurements. DPCA captures the time-dependent correlation structure of the
underlying pollutants recorded at up to 34 monitoring sites in the region. In
winter mornings the first principal component (PC1) (mainly CO and NO2)

stratified and quasi-steady heating predict the development of a state of
thermal non-equilibrium (TNE): cycles of evaporative upflows at the footpoints

analysis, we demonstrate that the observed periodic signals are indeed not
signatures of vibrational modes. Instead, superimposed on the power law
expected from the stochastic background emission, the power spectra of the time

  Methods: Using VLTI/PIONIER in H band we have carried out multi-epoch

These forecasting methods are validated\nthrough an empirical study of half-hourly concentrations of airborne\nparticulate matter in Graz, Austria.""}",[{'name': 'Han Lin Shang'}],{'name': 'Han Lin Shang'},Han Lin Shang,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07029v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.07029v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'stat.CO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'stat.CO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': '62G08, 62P12', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,"31 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables",,

Kepler} telescope as part of {\it K2} Campaign 6. The photometric time series
has one-minute time sampling and a precision of about 690~ppm, after filtering
out artifacts and spurious trends. We identify dozens of starspot-crossing
events, when the planet eclipsed a relatively dark region of the stellar
photosphere. The observed patterns in the sequence of these events demonstrate
that the planet always transits over the same range of stellar latitudes, and
therefore that the stellar obliquity is less than about 10$^\circ$. We support
this conclusion with two different modeling approaches: one based on explicit
identification and timing of the events, and the other based on fitting the
light curves with a spotted-star model. We are also able to refine the usual
transit parameters and measure the stellar rotation period ($18.5 \pm
1.9$~days), corresponding to a 'gyrochronological' age of $1.4 \pm 0.3$ Gyr.
Coherent flux variations with the same period as the transits are seen
throughout the entire light curve. These variations are well modeled as the
combined effects of ellipsoidal light variations ($17.4 \pm 2.8$~ppm) and
Doppler boosting ($11.9 \pm 2.5$~ppm). The magnitudes of these effects are both
consistent with a planetary mass of $2.6 \pm 0.5~ M_{\text{Jup}}$, which is in
turn consistent with the mass determined by the Doppler technique. No
occultations are detected, giving a 2$\sigma$ upper limit of $0.013$ on the
planet's visual geometric albedo. The measured transit times are consistent
with a constant orbital period. In particular we find no evidence for orbital
decay, although we are only able to place a weak lower bound on the relevant

optimizing classification rates, we identify a small number of determining

of variability types including currently unknown ones, we test 18 statistical
characteristics quantifying scatter and/or correlation between brightness
measurements. We compare their performance in identifying variable objects in
seven time series data sets obtained with telescopes ranging in size from a
telephoto lens to 1m-class and probing variability on time-scales from minutes
to decades. The test data sets together include lightcurves of 127539 objects,
among them 1251 variable stars of various types and represent a range of
observing conditions often found in ground-based variability surveys. The real
data are complemented by simulations. We propose a combination of two indices
that together recover a broad range of variability types from photometric data
characterized by a wide variety of sampling patterns, photometric accuracies,
and percentages of outlier measurements. The first index is the interquartile
range (IQR) of magnitude measurements, sensitive to variability irrespective of
a time-scale and resistant to outliers. It can be complemented by the ratio of
the lightcurve variance to the mean square successive difference, 1/h, which is
efficient in detecting variability on time-scales longer than the typical time
interval between observations. Variable objects have larger 1/h and/or IQR
values than non-variable objects of similar brightness. Another approach to

has so far been proven to be elusive. However, there are a number of scenarios
which could lead to quasi-periodic variations in blazar light curves. For
example, orbital or thermal/viscous period of accreting matter around central
supermassive black holes could, in principle, be imprinted in the
multi-wavelength emission of small-scale blazar jets, carrying as such crucial
information about plasma conditions within the jet launching regions. In this
paper, we present the results of our time series analysis of $\sim 9.2$
year-long, and exceptionally well-sampled optical light curve of the BL Lac OJ
287. The study primarily uses the data from our own observations performed at
the Mt. Suhora and Krak\'ow Observatories in Poland, and at the Athens

some of the gaps in the data. The Lomb-Scargle Periodogram and the Weighted
Wavelet Z-transform methods were employed to search for the possible QPOs in
the resulting optical light curve of the source. Both the methods consistently
yielded possible quasi-periodic signal around the periods of $\sim 400$ and
$\sim 800$ days, the former one with a significance (over the underlying
colored noise) of $\geq 99\%$. A number of likely explanations for such are
discussed, with a preference given to a modulation of the jet production
efficiency by highly magnetized accretion disks. This supports the previous
findings and the interpretation reported recently in the literature for OJ 287

fitting for a wavelength shift, a flux rescaling factor, and a change in the

uncertainties in the calibration. In a test case using data for MCG+08-11-011,
these modifications result in a calibration precision of $\sim\! 1$

quantifying mixing as well as the rate of production of hybrid compositions in
the mixing system. The Shannon entropy approach is applied to time series
numerical simulations and high-temperature experiments performed with natural
melts. We note that in both cases the Shannon entropy increases linearly during
the initial stages of mixing and then saturates toward constant values.
Furthermore, chemical elements with different mobilities display different
rates of increase of the Shannon entropy. This indicates that the hybrid
composition for the different elements is attained at different times
generating a wide range of spatio-compositional domains which further increase
the apparent complexity of the mixing process. Results from the application of
the Shannon entropy analysis are compared with the concept of Relaxation of
Concentration Variance (RCV), a measure recently introduced in petrology to
quantify chemical exchanges during magma mixing. We derive a linear expression
relating the change of concentration variance during mixing and the Shannon
entropy. We show that the combined use of Shannon entropy and RCV provides the
most complete information about the space and time complexity of magma mixing.
As a consequence, detailed information about this fundamental petrogenetic and
volcanic process can be gathered. In particular, the Shannon entropy can be
used as complement to the RCV method to quantify the mobility of chemical
elements in magma mixing systems, to obtain information about the rate of
production of compositional heterogeneities, and to derive empirical

the rising and falling in the occurrence of dark sunspots on the solar disk in
visible bandpasses. The 11-year cycle is also manifest in the variations of
emission in the Ca II H & K line cores, due to non-thermal (i.e. magnetic)
heating in the lower chromosphere. The large variation in Ca II H & K emission
allows for study of the patterns of long-term variability in other stars thanks
to synoptic monitoring with the Mount Wilson Observatory HK photometers
(1966-2003) and Lowell Observatory Solar-Stellar Spectrograph (1994-present).
Overlapping measurements for a set of 27 nearby solar-analog (spectral types
G0-G5) stars were used to calibrate the two instruments and construct time
series of magnetic activity up to 50 years in length. Precise properties of
fundamental importance to the dynamo are available from Hipparcos, the
Geneva-Copenhagen Survey, and CHARA interferometry. Using these long time

to within a few percent. Eclipsing binary systems hosting at least one star
with detectable solar-like oscillations constitute the ideal test objects for
validating asteroseismic radius and mass inferences. By combining
radial-velocity measurements and photometric time series of eclipses, it is
possible to determine the masses and radii of each component of a double-lined
spectroscopic binary. We report the results of a four-year radial-velocity
survey performed with the \'echelle spectrometer of the Astrophysical Research
Consortium's 3.5-m telescope and the APOGEE spectrometer at Apache Point
Observatory. We compare the masses and radii of 10 red giants obtained by
combining radial velocities and eclipse photometry with the estimates from the
asteroseismic scaling relations. We find that the asteroseismic scaling
relations overestimate red-giant radii by about 5% on average and masses by
about 15% for stars at various stages of red-giant evolution. Systematic
overestimation of mass leads to underestimation of stellar age, which can have
important implications for ensemble asteroseismology used for Galactic studies.
As part of a second objective, where asteroseismology is used for understanding
binary systems, we confirm that oscillations of red giants in close binaries

stability, and wavelength coverage for transiting exoplanet studies, opening up
new avenues for measuring atmospheric abundances, structure, and temperature
profiles. Taking full advantage of JWST spectroscopy of planets from 0.6um to
28um, however, will require many observations with a combination of the NIRISS,
NIRCam, NIRSpec, and MIRI instruments. In this white paper, we discuss a new
NIRCam mode (not yet approved or implemented) that can reduce the number of
necessary observations to cover the 1.0um to 5.0um wavelength range. Even
though NIRCam was designed primarily as an imager, it also includes several
grisms for phasing and aligning JWST's 18 hexagonal mirror segments. NIRCam's
long-wavelength channel includes grisms that cover 2.4um to 5.0um with a
resolving power of R = 1200 - 1550 using two separate configurations. The
long-wavelength grisms have already been approved for science operations,
including wide field and single object (time series) slitless spectroscopy. We
propose a new mode that will simultaneously measure spectra for science targets
in the 1.0um to 2.0um range using NIRCam's short-wavelength channel. This mode,
if approved, would take advantage of NIRCam's Dispersed Hartmann Sensor (DHS),
which produces 10 spatially separated spectra per source at R ~ 300. We discuss
the added benefit of the DHS in constraining abundances in exoplanet
atmospheres as well as its ability to observe the brightest systems. The DHS
essentially comes for free (at no time cost) with any NIRCam long-wavelength
grism observation, but the detector integration parameters have to be selected
to ensure that the long-wavelength grism observations do not saturate and that
JWST data volume downlink constraints are not violated.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers unprecedented sensitivity,\nstability, and wavelength coverage for transiting exoplanet studies, opening up\nnew avenues for measuring atmospheric abundances, structure, and temperature\nprofiles.

focused on the detection and characterization of rocky planets in the habitable
zone. Understanding their magnetic activity is important because it affects our

instrumental and atmospheric effects, and to provide flux-calibrated spectra in
units of flux at the stellar surface. The H&K and H{\alpha} fluxes are compared
with each other, and their variability is analyzed. We find that the H and K
flux excesses are strongly correlated with each other, while the H{\alpha} flux
excess is generally less correlated with the H&K doublet. We also find that
H{\alpha} emission does not increase monotonically with the H&K line flux,
showing some absorption before being filled in by chromospheric emission when
H&K activity increases. Analyzing the time variability of the emission fluxes,
we derive a tentative estimate of the rotation period (of the order of a few
tens of days) for some of the program stars, and the typical lifetime of
chromospheric active regions (a few stellar rotations). Our results are in good

Tomography requires the knowledge of the statistical turbulence parameters,
commonly recovered from the system telemetry using a dedicated profiling
technique. For demonstration purposes with the MOAO pathfinder Canary , this
identification is performed thanks to the Learn & Apply (L&A) algorithm, that
consists in model- fitting the covariance matrix of WFS measurements dependent

altitude layers from the ground in order to mitigate the lack of convergence of
the required empirical covariance matrices therefore reducing the required
length of data time-series for reaching a given accuracy. For nominal
observation conditions, the L3S can reach the same level of tomographic error

time-lagged influences, SEMs assert that causal dependencies arise due to
contemporaneous effects, and may even be adopted when nodal measurements are

data-driven applications. Sophisticated similarity measures are standard for
time series matching, as they are usually misaligned. Dynamic Time Warping or
DTW is the most widely used similarity measure for time series because it
combines alignment and matching at the same time. However, the alignment makes
DTW slow. To speed up the expensive similarity search with DTW, branch and
bound based pruning strategies are adopted. However, branch and bound based
pruning are only useful for very short queries (low dimensional time series),
and the bounds are quite weak for longer queries. Due to the loose bounds
branch and bound pruning strategy boils down to a brute-force search.
  To circumvent this issue, we design SSH (Sketch, Shingle, & Hashing), an
efficient and approximate hashing scheme which is much faster than the
state-of-the-art branch and bound searching technique: the UCR suite. SSH uses
a novel combination of sketching, shingling and hashing techniques to produce
(probabilistic) indexes which align (near perfectly) with DTW similarity
measure. The generated indexes are then used to create hash buckets for
sub-linear search. Our results show that SSH is very effective for longer time
sequence and prunes around 95% candidates, leading to the massive speedup in
search with DTW. Empirical results on two large-scale benchmark time series
data show that our proposed method can be around 20 times faster than the
state-of-the-art package (UCR suite) without any significant loss in accuracy.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Similarity search on time series is a frequent operation in large-scale\ndata-driven applications.

Due to the loose bounds\nbranch and bound pruning strategy boils down to a brute-force search.\n  To circumvent this issue, we design SSH (Sketch, Shingle, & Hashing), an\nefficient and approximate hashing scheme which is much faster than the\nstate-of-the-art branch and bound searching technique: the UCR suite. SSH uses\na novel combination of sketching, shingling and hashing techniques to produce\n(probabilistic) indexes which align (near perfectly) with DTW similarity\nmeasure. The generated indexes are then used to create hash buckets for\nsub-linear search. Our results show that SSH is very effective for longer time\nsequence and prunes around 95% candidates, leading to the massive speedup in\nsearch with DTW. Empirical results on two large-scale benchmark time series\ndata show that our proposed method can be around 20 times faster than the\nstate-of-the-art package (UCR suite) without any significant loss in accuracy.'}","[{'name': 'Chen Luo'}, {'name': 'Anshumali Shrivastava'}]",{'name': 'Anshumali Shrivastava'},Anshumali Shrivastava,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07328v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.07328v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.IR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.IR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,,

demonstrates the importance of model adequacy. An adequate model for seasonal
river flow must incorporate seasonal periodic correlation. The usual
autoregressive-moving average (ARMA) and seasonal ARMA models are not adequate

from sensor inputs for classification. Such applications face two challenges.
On one hand, on-device sensor measurements are noisy. For many mobile
applications, it is hard to find a distribution that exactly describes the
noise in practice. Unfortunately, calculating target quantities based on
physical system and noise models is only as accurate as the noise assumptions.
Similarly, in classification applications, although manually designed features
have proven to be effective, it is not always straightforward to find the most
robust features to accommodate diverse sensor noise patterns and user
behaviors. To this end, we propose DeepSense, a deep learning framework that
directly addresses the aforementioned noise and feature customization
challenges in a unified manner. DeepSense integrates convolutional and
recurrent neural networks to exploit local interactions among similar mobile
sensors, merge local interactions of different sensory modalities into global
interactions, and extract temporal relationships to model signal dynamics.
DeepSense thus provides a general signal estimation and classification
framework that accommodates a wide range of applications. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of DeepSense using three representative and challenging tasks:
car tracking with motion sensors, heterogeneous human activity recognition, and
user identification with biometric motion analysis. DeepSense significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for all three tasks. In addition,
DeepSense is feasible to implement on smartphones due to its moderate energy
consumption and low latency","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Mobile sensing applications usually require time-series inputs from sensors.\nSome applications, such as tracking, can use sensed acceleration and rate of\nrotation to calculate displacement based on physical system models.

The Sun and solar-like stars undergo activity cycles for which the
underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The oscillations of the Sun are
known to vary with its activity cycle and these changes provide diagnostics on
the conditions below the photosphere. Kepler has detected oscillations in
hundreds of solar-like stars but as of yet, no widespread detection of
signatures of magnetic activity cycles in the oscillation parameters of these
stars have been reported.
  Aims. We analyse the photometric short cadence Kepler time series of a set of
24 solar-like stars, which were observed for at least 960 days each, with the
aim to find signatures of stellar magnetic activity in the oscillation
parameters.
  Methods. We analyse the temporal evolution of oscillation parameters by
measuring mode frequency shifts, changes in the height of the p-mode envelope,
as well as granulation time scales.
  Results. For 23 of the 24 investigated stars, we find significant frequency
shifts in time. We present evidence for magnetic activity in six of them. We
find that the amplitude of the frequency shifts decreases with stellar age and
rotation period. For the most prominent example, KIC 8006161, we find that,
similar to the solar case, frequency shifts are smallest for the lowest and
largest for the highest p-mode frequencies.
  Conclusions. These findings show that magnetic activity can be routinely
observed in the oscillation parameters for solar-like stars, which opens up the
possibility to place the solar activity cycle in the context of other stars by
asteroseismology.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Context.

enables conversion of a line profile time series into a two-dimensional map of

different systematic errors on the reconstructed spot maps. We simulate
spectroscopic observational data for different spot distributions in the

chemical maps using different sets of spectral lines and making different

experiments demonstrate that a modern DI code successfully recovers the input
chemical spot distributions comprised of multiple circular spots at different
latitudes or an element overabundance belt at the magnetic equator. For the
optimal reconstruction the average reconstruction errors do not exceed ~0.10
dex. The errors increase to about 0.15 dex when abundance distributions are
recovered from a few and/or blended spectral lines. Ignoring a 2.5 kG dipolar
magnetic field in chemical abundance DI leads to an average relative error of
0.2 dex and maximum errors of 0.3 dex. Similar errors are encountered if a DI
inversion is carried out neglecting a non-uniform continuum brightness
distribution and variation of the local atmospheric structure. This series of

the non-magnetic radiative transfer and a single model atmosphere are generally

the estimation of the spectral decay ($\beta$), the generalized Hurst exponent

non-correlated data are used to set the best way to discriminate stochastic and

dispersion, and shape parameters. Many of dispersion and shape parameters are
unbound parameters, i.e. equations which do not require the calculation of the

non-correlated variability indices, sample size corrections, and a new noise

spatial appearance information from either one or multiple person images,
whilst ignore the space-time cues readily available in video or image-sequence
data. Moreover, they often assume the availability of exhaustively labelled
cross-view pairwise data for every camera pair, making them non-scalable to
ReID applications in real-world large scale camera networks. In this work, we
introduce a novel video based person ReID method capable of accurately matching
people across views from arbitrary unaligned image-sequences without any
labelled pairwise data. Specifically, we introduce a new space-time person
representation by encoding multiple granularities of spatio-temporal dynamics
in form of time series. Moreover, a Time Shift Dynamic Time Warping (TS-DTW)
model is derived for performing automatically alignment whilst achieving data
selection and matching between inherently inaccurate and incomplete sequences
in a unified way. We further extend the TS-DTW model for accommodating multiple
feature-sequences of an image-sequence in order to fuse information from
different descriptions. Crucially, this model does not require pairwise
labelled training data (i.e. unsupervised) therefore readily scalable to large
scale camera networks of arbitrary camera pairs without the need for exhaustive

Specifically, we examine what we call the split-door setting, where the outcome
variable can be split into two parts: one that is potentially affected by the
cause being studied and another that is independent of it, with both parts
sharing the same (unobserved) confounders. We show that under these conditions,
the problem of identification reduces to that of testing for independence among
observed variables, and present a method that uses this approach to
automatically find subsets of the data that are causally identified. We
demonstrate the method by estimating the causal impact of Amazon's recommender
system on traffic to product pages, finding thousands of examples within the
dataset that satisfy the split-door criterion. Unlike past studies based on
natural experiments that were limited to a single product category, our method
applies to a large and representative sample of products viewed on the site. In
line with previous work, we find that the widely-used click-through rate (CTR)
metric overestimates the causal impact of recommender systems; depending on the
product category, we estimate that 50-80\% of the traffic attributed to
recommender systems would have happened even without any recommendations. We

separate trends from noisy time series when no satisfactory models exist to fit
the data. However, conventional detrending methods depend on subjective choices
of detrending parameters. Here, we present a simple multivariate detrending
method based on available nonlinear forecasting techniques. These are in turn
based on state space reconstruction for which a strong theoretical
justification exists for their use in non-parametric forecasting. The
detrending method presented here is conceptually similar to Schreiber's noise
reduction method using state space reconstruction. However, we show that
Schreiber's method contains a minor flaw that can be overcome with forecasting.
Furthermore, our detrending method contains a simple but nontrivial extension
to multivariate time series. We apply the detrending method to multivariate
time series generated from the Van der Pol oscillator, the Lorenz equations,
the Hindmarsh-Rose model of neuronal spiking activity, and a univariate

weak equivalence principle (WEP) with a 10^-15 precision. To reach this
performance requires an accurate and robust data analysis method, especially
since the possible WEP violation signal will be dominated by a strongly colored
noise. An important complication is brought by the fact that some values will
be missing -therefore, the measured time series will not be strictly regularly

increases the noise in Fourier space, where the WEP violation signal is looked

per dimension, that can possibly formalize binary interactions in various
graphical structures and can be used to model opinion dynamics, epidemics,
financial and biological time series data, etc. We call this a Bernoulli
Autoregressive Process (BAR). A BAR process models a discrete-time vector
random sequence of $p$ scalar Bernoulli processes with autoregressive dynamics
and corresponds to a particular Markov Chain. The benefit from the
autoregressive dynamics is the description of a $2^p\times 2^p$ transition
matrix by at most $pd$ effective parameters for some $d\ll p$ or by two sparse
matrices of dimensions $p\times p^2$ and $p\times p$, respectively,
parameterizing the transitions. Additionally, we show that the BAR process
mixes rapidly, by proving that the mixing time is $O(\log p)$. The hidden
constant in the previous mixing time bound depends explicitly on the values of
the chain parameters and implicitly on the maximum allowed in-degree of a node
in the corresponding graph. For a network with $p$ nodes, where each node has
in-degree at most $d$ and corresponds to a scalar Bernoulli process generated
by a BAR, we provide a greedy algorithm that can efficiently learn the
structure of the underlying directed graph with a sample complexity
proportional to the mixing time of the BAR process. The sample complexity of
the proposed algorithm is nearly order-optimal as it is only a $\log p$ factor

The hidden\nconstant in the previous mixing time bound depends explicitly on the values of\nthe chain parameters and implicitly on the maximum allowed in-degree of a node\nin the corresponding graph. For a network with $p$ nodes, where each node has\nin-degree at most $d$ and corresponds to a scalar Bernoulli process generated\nby a BAR, we provide a greedy algorithm that can efficiently learn the\nstructure of the underlying directed graph with a sample complexity\nproportional to the mixing time of the BAR process. The sample complexity of\nthe proposed algorithm is nearly order-optimal as it is only a $\\log p$ factor\naway from an information-theoretic lower bound. We present simulation results\nillustrating the performance of our algorithm in various setups, including a\nmodel for a biological signaling network.'}","[{'name': 'Dimitrios Katselis'}, {'name': 'Carolyn L.

Zw 229.015 in the energy range $0.3 - 10.0$ keV. When fitted with a simple
power-law, the spectrum shows signatures of weak soft excess below 1.0 keV. We
find that both thermal comptonisation and relativistically blurred reflection
models provide the most acceptable spectral fits with plausible physical
explanations to the origin of the soft excess than do multicolour disc
blackbody and smeared wind absorption models. This motivated us to study the
variability properties of the soft and the hard X-ray emissions from the source
and the relationship between them to put further constraints on the above
models. Our analysis reveals that the variation in the $3.0 - 10.0$ keV band
lags that in the $0.3 - 1.0$ keV by $600^{+290}_{-280}$ s, while the lag
between the $1.0 - 10.0$ keV and $0.3 - 1.0$ keV is $980^{+500}_{-500}$ s. This
implies that the X-ray emissions are possibly emanating from different regions
within the system. From these values, we estimate the X-ray emission region to
be within $20R_g$ of the central supermassive black hole (where $R_g=GM/c^2$,
$M$ is the mass of black hole, $G$ the Newton gravitational constant and $c$
the speed of light). Furthermore, we use XMM-Newton and Kepler photometric
lightcurves of the source to search for possible nonlinear signature in the
flux variability. We find evidence that the variability in the system may be
dominated by stochasticity rather than deterministic chaos which has
implications for the dynamics of the accretion system.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We analyse the spectra of the archival XMM-Newton data of the Seyfert 1 AGN\nZw 229.015 in the energy range $0.3 - 10.0$ keV.

hindcast missing historical TSI values. We try to avoid arbitrary choices of
the free parameters of the model by computing them using an optimization
procedure. The method can be regarded as a general tool for pairs of data sets,
where correlating and anticorrelating components can be separated into

transfer function combined with de-trending and computation of envelope curves.
  We find a major controversy between the historical proxies and
satellite-measured targets: a large variance is detected between the
low-frequency parts of targets, while the low-frequency proxy behavior of
different measurement series is consistent with high precision. We also show
that even though the rotational signal is not strongly manifested in the
targets and proxies, it becomes clearly visible in FDC spectrum.

implemented in terms of their network dynamics. Hence, recovering the system
dynamics from experimentally observed neuronal time series, like multiple
single-unit (MSU) recordings or neuroimaging data, is an important step toward
understanding its computations. Ideally, one would not only seek a state space
representation of the dynamics, but would wish to have access to its governing
equations for in-depth analysis. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a
computationally powerful and dynamically universal formal framework which has
been extensively studied from both the computational and the dynamical systems
perspective. Here we develop a semi-analytical maximum-likelihood estimation
scheme for piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) within the statistical framework of
state space models, which accounts for noise in both the underlying latent
dynamics and the observation process. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is
used to infer the latent state distribution, through a global Laplace
approximation, and the PLRNN parameters iteratively. After validating the
procedure on toy examples, the approach is applied to MSU recordings from the
rodent anterior cingulate cortex obtained during performance of a classical
working memory task, delayed alternation. A model with 5 states turned out to
be sufficient to capture the essential computational dynamics underlying task
performance, including stimulus-selective delay activity. The estimated models
were rarely multi-stable, but rather were tuned to exhibit slow dynamics in the
vicinity of a bifurcation point. In summary, the present work advances a

Hence, recovering the system\ndynamics from experimentally observed neuronal time series, like multiple\nsingle-unit (MSU) recordings or neuroimaging data, is an important step toward\nunderstanding its computations. Ideally, one would not only seek a state space\nrepresentation of the dynamics, but would wish to have access to its governing\nequations for in-depth analysis. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a\ncomputationally powerful and dynamically universal formal framework which has\nbeen extensively studied from both the computational and the dynamical systems\nperspective. Here we develop a semi-analytical maximum-likelihood estimation\nscheme for piecewise-linear RNNs (PLRNNs) within the statistical framework of\nstate space models, which accounts for noise in both the underlying latent\ndynamics and the observation process. The Expectation-Maximization algorithm is\nused to infer the latent state distribution, through a global Laplace\napproximation, and the PLRNN parameters iteratively. After validating the\nprocedure on toy examples, the approach is applied to MSU recordings from the\nrodent anterior cingulate cortex obtained during performance of a classical\nworking memory task, delayed alternation. A model with 5 states turned out to\nbe sufficient to capture the essential computational dynamics underlying task\nperformance, including stimulus-selective delay activity. The estimated models\nwere rarely multi-stable, but rather were tuned to exhibit slow dynamics in the\nvicinity of a bifurcation point.

selection which typically limits the number candidate models considered due to
the intractability of computing information criteria. Using a recently
developed sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics algorithm, the
sub-selection of candidate models near the Pareto frontier allows for a
tractable computation of AIC (Akaike information criteria) or BIC (Bayes
information criteria) scores for the remaining candidate models. The
information criteria hierarchically ranks the most informative models, enabling
the automatic and principled selection of the model with the strongest support
in relation to the time series data. Specifically, we show that AIC scores
place each candidate model in the {\em strong support}, {\em weak support} or
{\em no support} category. The method correctly identifies several canonical
dynamical systems, including an SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered)
disease model and the Lorenz equations, giving the correct dynamical system as

degradation from optical Earth Observation data. Part one comprises an overview
of currently available optical remote sensing sensors, which can be used for
forest disturbance and degradation mapping. Part two reviews the two main
categories of existing approaches: classical image-to-image change detection
and time series analysis. Recent findings: With the launch of the Sentinel-2a
satellite and available Landsat imagery, time series analysis has become the
most promising but also most demanding category of degradation mapping
approaches. Four time series classification methods are distinguished. The
methods are explained and their benefits and drawbacks are discussed. A
separate chapter presents a number of recent forest degradation mapping studies
for two different ecosystems: temperate forests with a geographical focus on
Europe and tropical forests with a geographical focus on Africa. Summary: The
review revealed that a wide variety of methods for the detection of forest
degradation is already available. Today, the main challenge is to transfer
these approaches to high resolution time series data from multiple sensors.
Future research should also focus on the classification of disturbance types

to infer total populations from limited observations. Monitoring observations
may give a biassed view of the underlying population due to limitations on
observing time, visibility and instrumental sensitivity. A similar problem
exists in the life sciences, where animal populations (such as migratory birds)
or disease prevalence, must be estimated from sparse and incomplete data. The
class of methods termed Capture-Recapture is used to reconstruct population
estimates from time-series records of encounters with the study population.
This paper investigates the performance of Capture-Recapture methods in
astronomy via a series of numerical simulations. The Blackbirds code simulates
monitoring of populations of transients, in this case accreting binary stars
(neutron star or black hole accreting from a stellar companion) under a range
of observing strategies. We first generate realistic light-curves for
populations of binaries with contrasting orbital period distributions. These
models are then randomly sampled at observing cadences typical of existing and
planned monitoring surveys. The classical capture-recapture methods,
Lincoln-Peterson, Schnabel estimators, related techniques, and newer methods
implemented in the Rcapture package are compared. A general exponential model
based on the radioactive decay law is introduced, and demonstrated to recover
(at 95% confidence) the underlying population abundance and duty cycle, in a
fraction of the observing visits (10-50%) required to discover all the sources
in the simulation. Capture-Recapture is a promising addition to the toolbox of

levitating without mechanical support, can either be laminar or turbulent,
depending on the velocity amplitude. Below a critical velocity $v_c$ that
scales as $\omega ^{1/2}$, and is temperature independent below 1 K, the flow
is laminar (potential flow). Below 0.5 K the linear drag force is caused by
ballistic phonon scattering that vanishes as T$^4$ until background damping,
measured in the empty cell, becomes dominant for T $<$ 0.1 K. Increasing the
velocity amplitude above $v_c$ leads to a transition from potential flow to
turbulence, where the large turbulent drag force varies as $(v^2 - v_c^2)$. In
a small velocity interval $\Delta v / v_c \le 3 \%$ above $v_c$, the flow is
unstable below 0.5 K, switching intermittently between both patterns. From time
series recorded at constant temperature and driving force, the lifetimes of
both phases are analyzed statistically. We observe metastable states of
potential flow which, after a mean lifetime of 25 minutes, ultimately break
down due to vorticity created by natural background radioactivity. The
lifetimes of the turbulent phases have an exponential distribution, and the
mean increases exponentially with $\Delta v^2$. We investigate the frequency at
which the vortex rings are shed from the sphere. Our results are compared with
recent data of other authors on vortex shedding by moving a laser beam through
a Bose-Einstein condensate. Finally, we show that our observed transition to
turbulence belongs to the class of ""supertransient chaos"" where lifetimes of
the turbulent states increase faster than exponentially. Peculiar results
obtained in dilute $^3$He - $^4$He mixtures are presented in the Appendix.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The flow of superfluid $^4$He around a translationally oscillating sphere,\nlevitating without mechanical support, can either be laminar or turbulent,\ndepending on the velocity amplitude.

Increasing the\nvelocity amplitude above $v_c$ leads to a transition from potential flow to\nturbulence, where the large turbulent drag force varies as $(v^2 - v_c^2)$. In\na small velocity interval $\\Delta v / v_c \\le 3 \\%$ above $v_c$, the flow is\nunstable below 0.5 K, switching intermittently between both patterns. From time\nseries recorded at constant temperature and driving force, the lifetimes of\nboth phases are analyzed statistically. We observe metastable states of\npotential flow which, after a mean lifetime of 25 minutes, ultimately break\ndown due to vorticity created by natural background radioactivity. The\nlifetimes of the turbulent phases have an exponential distribution, and the\nmean increases exponentially with $\\Delta v^2$. We investigate the frequency at\nwhich the vortex rings are shed from the sphere. Our results are compared with\nrecent data of other authors on vortex shedding by moving a laser beam through\na Bose-Einstein condensate. Finally, we show that our observed transition to\nturbulence belongs to the class of ""supertransient chaos"" where lifetimes of\nthe turbulent states increase faster than exponentially.

visualized as a 3D trajectory, HyperTools uses dimensionality reduction
algorithms to create similar 2D and 3D trajectories for time series of

static plots or visualized as animations. These same dimensionality reduction

$I$-band data in the LMC from OGLE and $K_s$-band data in the Galactic Bulge
from VVV and use them to obtain robust mean magnitudes. We derive
Period-Luminosity (P-L) relations in the near-infrared and Period-Wesenheit

relations are consistent with published work when excluding long-period RV
Tauris. We find that Pop II Cepheids and RR Lyraes follow the same P-L
relations in the LMC. Therefore, we use trigonometric parallax from the {\it
Gaia DR1} for VY~Pyx and the {\it Hubble Space Telescope} parallaxes for
$k$~Pav and 5 RR Lyrae variables to obtain an absolute calibration of the
Galactic $K_s$-band P-L relation, resulting in a distance modulus to the LMC of
$\mu_{\rm LMC} = 18.54\pm0.08$~mag. We update the mean magnitudes of Pop~II
Cepheids in Galactic globular clusters using our light curve templates and
obtain distance estimates to those systems, anchored to a precise late-type
eclipsing binary distance to the LMC. We find the distances to these globular

characteristic without a priori knowledge (e.g., number of possible unique
characteristics) at a lower logical level, and capture the transitions from one
low-level model to another at a higher level. In this context, the concepts in
the recently developed Symbolic Dynamic Filtering (SDF) is extended, to build
an online algorithm suited for handling quasi-stationary data at a lower level
and a non-stationary behavior at a higher level without a priori knowledge. A
key observation made in this study is that the rate of change of data
likelihood seems to be a better indicator of change in data characteristics
compared to the traditional methods that mostly consider data likelihood for
change detection. The algorithm minimizes model complexity and captures data

algorithm are performed using time series data simulated from systems that
exhibit nonlinear dynamics. We discuss results that show that the proposed
hierarchical SDF algorithm can identify underlying features with significantly
high degree of accuracy, even under very noisy conditions. Algorithm is

of a large set of RR Lyrae variables in a globular cluster. The radial-velocity
data presented comprise the largest sample of RVs of RR Lyrae stars ever
obtained. The target is M3; $BVI_{\mathrm{C}}$ time-series of 111 and $b$ flux
data of further 64 RRab stars, and RV data of 79 RR Lyrae stars are published.
Blazhko modulation of the light curves of 47 percent of the RRab stars are
detected. The mean value of the center-of-mass velocities of RR Lyrae stars is
$-146.8$ km s$^{-1}$ with 4.52 km s$^{-1}$ standard deviation, which is in good
agreement with the results obtained for the red giants of the cluster. The
${\Phi_{21}}^{\mathrm RV}$ phase difference of the RV curves of RRab stars is
found to be uniformly constant both for the M3 and for Galactic field RRab
stars; no period or metallicity dependence of the ${\Phi_{21}}^{\mathrm RV}$ is
detected. The Baade-Wesselink distances of 26 non-Blazhko variables with the
best phase-coverage radial-velocity curves are determined; the corresponding
distance of the cluster, $10480\pm210$ pc, agrees with the previous literature
information. A quadratic formula for the $A_{\mathrm{puls}}-A_V$ relation of
RRab stars is given, which is valid for both OoI and OoII variables. We also

over a billion time series from the Gaia mission. Crossmatching known variable
sources with those from Gaia is crucial to incorporate current knowledge,
understand how these objects appear in the Gaia data, train supervised
classifiers to recognise known classes, and validate the results of the
Variability Processing and Analysis Coordination Unit (CU7) within the Gaia
Data Analysis and Processing Consortium (DPAC). The method employed by CU7 to
crossmatch variables for the first Gaia data release includes a binary
classifier to take into account positional uncertainties, proper motion,
targeted variability signals, and artefacts present in the early calibration of
the Gaia data. Crossmatching with a classifier makes it possible to automate
all those decisions which are typically made during visual inspection. The
classifier can be trained with objects characterized by a variety of attributes
to ensure similarity in multiple dimensions (astrometry, photometry,
time-series features), with no need for a-priori transformations to compare
different photometric bands, or of predictive models of the motion of objects

efficient management of power systems, which has been studied intensively over
the past 50 years. The emerging development of smart grid technologies is
posing new challenges as well as opportunities to STLF. Load data, collected at
higher geographical granularity and frequency through thousands of smart
meters, allows us to build a more accurate local load forecasting model, which
is essential for local optimization of power load through demand side
management. With this paper, we show how several existing approaches for STLF
are not applicable on local load forecasting, either because of long training
time, unstable optimization process, or sensitivity to hyper-parameters.
Accordingly, we select five models suitable for local STFL, which can be
trained on different time-series with limited intervention from the user. The
experiment, which consists of 40 time-series collected at different locations
and aggregation levels, revealed that yearly pattern and temperature
information are only useful for high aggregation level STLF. On local STLF
task, the modified version of double seasonal Holt-Winter proposed in this

time-series on the privacy of individuals contributing to the aggregation. We
introduce a framework allowing us to reason about privacy against an adversary
attempting to predict users' locations or recover their mobility patterns. We
formalize these attacks as inference problems, and discuss a few strategies to
model the adversary's prior knowledge based on the information she may have
access to. We then use the framework to quantify the privacy loss stemming from
aggregate location data, with and without the protection of differential
privacy, using two real-world mobility datasets. We find that aggregates do
leak information about individuals' punctual locations and mobility profiles.
The density of the observations, as well as timing, play important roles, e.g.,
regular patterns during peak hours are better protected than sporadic
movements. Finally, our evaluation shows that both output and input
perturbation offer little additional protection, unless they introduce large
amounts of noise ultimately destroying the utility of the data.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""Information about people's movements and the locations they visit enables an\nincreasing number of mobility analytics applications, e.g., in the context of\nurban and transportation planning, In this setting, rather than collecting or\nsharing raw data, entities often use aggregation as a privacy protection\nmechanism, aiming to hide individual users' location traces.

We measure a radial velocity signal\ninduced by rotational modulation of stellar surface features in 37 stars, from\nlate F-type to mid M-type stars. We report an empirical relationship, with some\ndegree of spectral type dependency, between the mean level of chromospheric\nemission measured by the log(Rhk) and the measured radial velocity semi\namplitude. We also report a relationship betweeen the semi amplitude of the\nchromospheric measured signal and the semi amplitude of the radial velocity\ninduced signal, which strongly depends on the spectral type. We find that for a\ngiven strength of chromospheric activity (i.e. a given rotation period) M-type\nstars tend to induce larger rotation related radial velocity signals than G and\nK-type stars.'}","[{'name': 'A.

of 231 transiting giant planets (TGPs) that are alone or have distant
companions; we employed DE-MCMC methods to analyse radial-velocity (RV) data
from the literature and 782 new high-accuracy RVs obtained with the HARPS-N
spectrograph for 45 systems over 3 years. Our work yields the largest sample of
systems with a transiting giant exoplanet and coherently determined orbital,
planetary, and stellar parameters. We found that the orbital parameters of TGPs
in non-compact planetary systems are clearly shaped by tides raised by their
host stars. Indeed, the most eccentric planets have relatively large orbital
separations and/or high mass ratios, as expected from the equilibrium tide
theory. This feature would be the outcome of high-eccentricity migration (HEM).
The distribution of $\alpha=a/a_R$, where $a$ and $a_R$ are the semi-major axis
and the Roche limit, for well-determined circular orbits peaks at 2.5; this
also agrees with expectations from the HEM. The few planets of our sample with
circular orbits and $\alpha >5$ values may have migrated through disc-planet
interactions instead of HEM. By comparing circularisation times with stellar
ages, we found that hot Jupiters with $a < 0.05$ au have modified tidal quality
factors $10^{5} < Q'_p < 10^{9}$, and that stellar $Q'_s > 10^{6}-10^{7}$ are
required to explain the presence of eccentric planets at the same orbital
distance. As a by-product of our analysis, we detected a non-zero eccentricity
for HAT-P-29; we determined that five planets that were previously regarded to
have hints of non-zero eccentricity have circular orbits or undetermined

important to constrain their physical parameters and internal angular momentum
distribution to calibrate stellar structure and evolution models. Stellar
internal rotation can be probed through asteroseismic studies of rotationally
split oscillations but such results are still quite rare, especially for stars

observations made by BRITE - Constellation and the SMEI on board the Coriolis
satellite, high-resolution spectroscopy, and more than 96 years of radial
velocity measurements. We identify a sequence of 9 rotationally split dipole
modes in the photometric time series and establish that HD201433 is in
principle a solid-body rotator with a very slow rotation period of 297+/-76 d.
Tidal interaction with the inner companion has, however, significantly
accelerated the spin of the surface layers by a factor of approximately one
hundred. The angular momentum transfer onto the surface of HD201433 is also
reflected by the statistically significant decrease of the orbital period of
about 0.9 s during the last 96 years. Combining the asteroseismic inferences
with the spectroscopic measurements and the orbital analysis of the inner

understanding, the same does not quite hold for video processing. Architectures
and optimization techniques used for video are largely based off those for
static images, potentially underutilizing rich video information. In this work,
we rethink both the underlying network architecture and the stochastic learning
paradigm for temporal data. To do so, we draw inspiration from classic theory
on linear dynamic systems for modeling time series. By extending such models to
include nonlinear mappings, we derive a series of novel recurrent neural
networks that sequentially make top-down predictions about the future and then
correct those predictions with bottom-up observations. Predictive-corrective
networks have a number of desirable properties: (1) they can adaptively focus
computation on ""surprising"" frames where predictions require large corrections,
(2) they simplify learning in that only ""residual-like"" corrective terms need
to be learned over time and (3) they naturally decorrelate an input data stream
in a hierarchical fashion, producing a more reliable signal for learning at

non-linear analysis of multi-channel time series, notably multivariate
multiscale entropy (mvMSE), has been extensively used in biomedical signal
processing. However, mvMSE has three drawbacks: 1) mvMSE values are either
undefined or unreliable for short signals; 2) mvMSE is not fast enough for
real-time applications; and 3) the computation of mvMSE for signals with a
large number of channels requires the storage of a huge number of elements.
Methods: To deal with these problems and improve the stability of mvMSE, we
introduce multivariate multiscale dispersion entropy (MDE - mvMDE) as an
extension of our recently developed MDE, to quantify the complexity of
multivariate time series. Results: We assess mvMDE, in comparison with mvMSE
and multivariate multiscale fuzzy entropy (mvMFE), on correlated and
uncorrelated multi-channel noise signals, bivariate autoregressive processes,
and three biomedical datasets. The results show that mvMDE takes into account
dependencies in patterns across both the time and spatial domains. The mvMDE,
mvMSE, and mvMFE methods are consistent in that they lead to similar
conclusions about the underlying physiological conditions. However, the
proposed mvMDE discriminates various physiological states of the biomedical
recordings better than mvMSE and mvMFE. In addition, for both the short and
long time series, the mvMDE-based results are noticeably more stable than the
mvMSE- and mvMFE-based ones. Conclusion: For short multivariate time series,
mvMDE, unlike mvMSE, does not result in undefined values. Furthermore, mvMDE is
noticeably faster than mvMFE and mvMSE and also needs to store a considerably
smaller number of elements. Significance: Due to its ability to detect
different kinds of dynamics of multivariate signals, mvMDE has great potential
to analyse various physiological signals.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=5000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Objective: Due to the non-linearity of numerous biomedical signals,\nnon-linear analysis of multi-channel time series, notably multivariate\nmultiscale entropy (mvMSE), has been extensively used in biomedical signal\nprocessing.
