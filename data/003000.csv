from M32 while the other is located 15 arcmin to the southeast of M31. We

RR Lyraes relative to the center of M32. This gradient is consistent with the

M32 contains an ancient stellar population formed around the same time as the

the metal abundance of the overall M32 stellar population. Moreover, the
abundance of RR Lyrae stars normalized to the luminosity of M32 in the field

the dominant M31 halo, while the metal-poorer group could be a disrupted dwarf

delta-spot and a decaying satellite sunspot of opposite polarity. The objective
of this study is to characterize the photometric decay of the satellite sunspot
and the evolution of photospheric and chromospheric horizontal proper motions
in its surroundings. We apply the local correlation tracking technique to a
16-hour time-series of Hinode G-band and CaIIH images and study the horizontal
proper motions in the vicinity of the satellite sunspot on 2006 December 7.
Decorrelation times were computed to measure the lifetime of solar features in
intensity and flow maps. We observed shear flows in the dominant umbral cores
of the satellite sunspot. These flows vanished once the penumbra had
disappeared. This slow penumbral decay had an average rate of 152Mm2/day over
an 11-hour period. Typical lifetimes of intensity features derived from an
autocorrelation analysis are 3-5min for granulation, 25-35min for G-band bright
points, and up to 200-235min for penumbrae, umbrae, and pores. Long-lived
intensity features (i.e., the dominant umbral cores) are not related to
long-lived flow features in the northern part of the sunspot, where flux
removal, slowly decaying penumbrae, and persistent horizontal flows of up to 1
km/s contribute to the erosion of the sunspot. Finally, the restructuring of
magnetic field topology was responsible for a homologous M2.0 flare, which
shared many characteristics with an X6.5 flare on the previous day.
Notwithstanding the prominent role of delta-spots in flaring, we conclude based
on the decomposition of the satellite sunspot, the evolution of the surrounding
flow fields, and the timing of the M2.0 flare that the vanishing magnetic flux
in the decaying satellite sunspot played an instrumental role in triggering the
homologous M2.0 flare and the eruption of a small Halpha filament.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=3000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The flare-prolific active region NOAA 10930 offered both a developing\ndelta-spot and a decaying satellite sunspot of opposite polarity.

method of parallel MRI makes use of an autocalibration scan (ACS) to determine
a set of synthesis coefficients to be used in the image reconstruction. For EPI
time series the ACS data is usually acquired once prior to the time series. In
this case the interleaved R-shot EPI trajectory, where R is the GRAPPA
reduction factor, offers advantages which we justify from a theoretical and
experimental perspective. Unfortunately, interleaved R-shot ACS can be
corrupted due to perturbations to the signal (such as direct and indirect
motion effects) occurring between the shots, and these perturbations may lead
to artifacts in GRAPPA-reconstructed images. Consequently we also present a
method of acquiring interleaved ACS data in a manner which can reduce the
effects of inter-shot signal perturbations. This method makes use of the phase
correction data, conveniently a part of many standard EPI sequences, to assess
the signal perturbations between the segments of R-shot EPI ACS scans. The
phase correction scans serve as navigator echoes, or more accurately a
perturbation-sensitive signal, to which a root-mean-square deviation
perturbation metric is applied for the determination of the best available
complete ACS data set among multiple complete sets of ACS data acquired prior
to the EPI time series. This best set (assumed to be that with the smallest
valued perturbation metric) is used in the GRAPPA autocalibration algorithm,
thereby permitting considerable improvement in both image quality and temporal
signal-to-noise ratio of the subsequent EPI time series at the expense of a
small increase in overall acquisition time.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=3000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The GRAPPA (GeneRalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel Acquisitions)\nmethod of parallel MRI makes use of an autocalibration scan (ACS) to determine\na set of synthesis coefficients to be used in the image reconstruction.

can be utilized in this context. The connection between functional and

Intensity oscillations of 3 minutes are observed to encompass photospheric
umbral dot structures, with power at least three orders-of-magnitude higher
than the surrounding umbra. Simultaneous chromospheric velocity and intensity
time series reveal an 87 \pm 8 degree out-of-phase behavior, implying the
presence of standing modes created as a result of partial wave reflection at
the transition region boundary. An average blue-shifted Doppler velocity of
~1.5 km/s, in addition to a time lag between photospheric and chromospheric
oscillatory phenomena, confirms the presence of upwardly-propagating slow-mode
waves in the lower solar atmosphere. Propagating oscillations in EUV intensity
are detected in simultaneous coronal fan structures, with a periodicity of 172
\pm 17 s and a propagation velocity of 45 \pm 7 km/s. Numerical simulations
reveal that the damping of the magneto-acoustic wave trains is dominated by
thermal conduction. The coronal fans are seen to anchor into the photosphere in

kinetic temperature and emission measure time-series display prominent
out-of-phase characteristics, and when combined with the previously established

methods have been largely dismissed by the professional community. The reasons
for this are numerous and varied, but inevitably amongst the reasons given is
that the systems designed often do not perform as expected by their designers.
The reasons for this lack of performance is a direct result of mistakes that
are commonly seen in market-prediction systems. This paper examines some of the
more common mistakes, namely dataset insufficiency; inappropriate scaling;

of the presence of a neutron star in the system. When the pulsations are missed
in the radio band, their detection at other wavelengths, like X-ray or
gamma-rays, requires orbital demodulation, since the length of the observations
are often comparable to, or longer than the system orbital period. The detailed
knowledge of the orbital parameters of binary systems plays a crucial role in
the detection of the spin period of pulsars, since any uncertainty in their
determination translates into a loss in the coherence of the signal during the
demodulation process. In this paper, we present an analytical study aimed at
unveiling how the uncertainties in the orbital parameters might impact on
periodicity searches. We find a correlation between the power of the signal in
the demodulated arrival time series and the uncertainty in each of the orbital
parameters. This correlation is also a function of the pulsar frequency. We
test our analytical results with numerical simulations, finding good agreement
between them. Finally, we apply our study to the cases of LS 5039 and LS I +61
303 and consider the current level of uncertainties in the orbital parameters
of these systems and their impact on a possible detection of a hosted pulsar.
We also discuss the possible appearance of a sideband ambiguity in real data.
The latter can occur when, due to the use of uncertain orbital parameters, the
power of a putative pulsar is distributed in frequencies lying nearby the
pulsar period. Even if the appearance of a sideband is already a signature of a
pulsar component, it may introduce an ambiguity in the determination of its
period.

that the examined cases of aperiodic oscillations in the heat evolution

A large variety of the test\nresults has been obtained for the calorimetric time series recorded in\nthermokinetic oscillations, periodic and quasiperiodic, accompanying the\nsorption of H2 or D2 with Pd as well as for several non oscillatory\ncalorimetric curves recorded in this reaction. These experimental datasets, all\ncoming form presumably deterministic processes, yielded the results clustering\naround 0.001. On the other hand, certain databases that were presumably random\nor non smooth yielded the test results from 0.7 to 1.9. Against these\nbenchmarks, the examined, experimental, aperiodic oscillations gave the test\nresults between 0.004 and 0.01, which appear to be much closer to the\ndeterministic behavior than to randomness. Consequently, it has been concluded\nthat the examined cases of aperiodic oscillations in the heat evolution\naccompanying the sorption of H2 or D2 in palladium may represent an occurrence\nof mathematical chaos in the behavior of this system. Further applicability and\nlimitations of the test have also been discussed, including its intrinsic\ninability to detect determinism in discrete time series.'}",[{'name': 'Erwin Lalik'}],{'name': 'Erwin Lalik'},Erwin Lalik,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.3873v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.3873v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'physics.chem-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'physics.chem-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'nlin.CD', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,"17 pages, 5 figures",

frequent, high peaks of emission. The averaged light curve of the peaks is
directly measured from the time series, and it is shown that (i) peaks occur at

density and the frequency-dependent phase lags of the peak light curves are

telescope system dedicated to searching for optical transient events. Small
telescope tubes are mounted on a tracking, semi-equatorial frame with a single
polar axis. Each fixed declination telescope records successive exposures which
overlap in right ascension. Nightly observations produce time-series images of
fixed fields within each declination band. We describe the TOSS data pipeline,
including automated routines used for image calibration, object detection and
identification, astrometry, and differential photometry. Time series of nightly
observations are accumulated in a database for each declination band. Despite
the modest cost of the mechanical system, results from the 2009-2010 observing

In particular, our variational HEM algorithm effectively leverages\nlarge amounts of data when learning annotation models by using an efficient\nhierarchical estimation procedure, which reduces learning times and memory\nrequirements, while improving model robustness through better regularization.'}","[{'name': 'Emanuele Coviello'}, {'name': 'Antoni B.

cool companion. The orbital period is 0.1185079936 +/- 0.0000000009 days, or
about three hours. Analysis of our time-series spectroscopy reveals a velocity
semi-amplitude of K_1 = 71.6 +/- 1.7 km/s for the sdB and best-fitting
atmospheric parameters of Teff = 28900 +/- 500 K, log g = 5.64 +/- 0.06, and

We give exact results on the asymptotic behaviour of the model and we\nshow that the interevent time distribution is power-law decaying for any kind\nof input distributions that remain normalizable in the infinite list limit,\nwith exponents tunable between 1 and 2. The model satisfies a scaling law\nbetween the exponents of interevent time distribution (alpha) and\nautocorrelation function (beta): alpha + beta = 2. This law is general for\nrenewal processes with power-law decaying interevent time distribution. We\nconclude that slowly decaying autocorrelation function indicates long-range\ndependency only if the scaling law is violated.'}","[{'name': 'Szabolcs Vajna'}, {'name': 'Bálint Tóth'}, {'name': 'János Kertész'}]",{'name': 'János Kertész'},János Kertész,10.1088/1367-2630/15/10/103023,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/15/10/103023', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1175v2', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1211.1175v2', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'physics.data-an', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,6 figures,New J.

evaluate reliable scale-invariance embedded in different sleep stages and
stride records. Segments corresponding to Wake, light sleep, REM, and deep
sleep stages are extracted from long-term EEG signals. For each stage the
scaling value distributes in a considerable wide range, which tell us that the
scaling behavior is subject- and sleep cycle- dependent. The average of the
scaling exponent values for wake segments is almost the same with that for REM
segments ($\sim 0.8$). Wake and REM stages have significant high value of
average scaling exponent, compared with that for light sleep stages ($\sim
0.7$). For the stride series, the original diffusion entropy (DE) and balanced
estimation of diffusion entropy (BEDE) give almost the same results for
de-trended series. Evolutions of local scaling invariance show that the
physiological states change abruptly, though in the experiments great efforts
have been done to keep conditions unchanged. Global behaviors of a single
physiological signal may lose rich information on physiological states.
Methodologically, BEDE can evaluate with considerable precision
scale-invariance in very short time series ($\sim 10^2$), while the original DE
method sometimes may underestimate scale-invariance exponents or even fail in
detecting scale-invariant behavior. The BEDE method is sensitive to trends in

in global economies. We investigate the statistical properties of the

futures, which are defined as the waiting times $\tau$ between consecutive
volatilities exceeding a given threshold $q$. We find that the recurrence
intervals are distributed as a stretched exponential $P_q(\tau)\sim

$q$, and there is no scaling behavior in the distributions for different
thresholds $q$ after the recurrence intervals are scaled with the mean

which is significantly shorter than the spin rate of the white dwarf. To
achieve this cadence, we used the blue arm of the ISIS spectrograph at the

to a robust determination of the spin period of the white dwarf (Pspin=67.619

complex emission line variations in Hgamma, He I 4472 and He II 4686. We
attribute the observed spin phase dependence of the emission line shape to the
presence of magnetically controlled accretion onto the white dwarf via
accretion curtains, consistent with an intermediate polar type system. We are,
however, not aware of any specific model that can quantitatively explain the
complex velocity variations we detect in our observations. The orbital
variations in the spectral lines indicate that the accretion disc of V455 And

Cygnus and Lyra constellations, is the target of the most intensive search for
transiting planets to date. The Kepler mission provides superior time series
photometry, with an enormous impact on all areas of stellar variability. The
initial release catalogue (Greiss et al. 2012) concerned data taken between May
and August 2011, using the Isaac Newton Telescope on the island of La Palma.
Four broadband filters were used, U, g, r, i, as well as one narrowband one,
H-alpha, reaching down to a limit of ~20th mag in the Vega system. Observations
covering ~50 sq.deg passed our quality control thresholds and constituted the
first data release. Here we report on the second data release, covering an
additional ~63 sq.deg of the Kepler field. We apply the exact same quality
control criteria and photometric calibration as in the initial release
catalogue (see Greiss et al. (2012) for further details). The global
photometric calibration was derived by placing the KIS magnitudes as close as
possible to the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) ones. The second data release
catalogue containing ~14.5 million sources from all the good photometric KIS
fields is available for download from the KIS webpage, as well as from the
Kepler Target Search page at MAST. It includes all the objects from the initial
data release catalogue and covers ~97% of the Kepler field. Therefore this
release adds ~8.5 million sources to the initial data release catalogue, all

theory, but lack observational evidence. We present the investigation of
variability caused by rotation and (gammaDoradus-type) pulsation in two
pre-main sequence members of the young open cluster NGC2264 using
high-precision time series photometry from the CoRoT satellite and dedicated
high-resolution spectroscopy. Time series photometry of NGC2264VAS20 and NGC
2264VAS87 was obtained by the CoRoT satellite during the dedicated short run
SRa01 in March 2008. NGC2264VAS87 was re-observed by CoRoT during the short run
SRa05 in December 2011 and January 2012. Frequency analysis was conducted using
Period04 and SigSpec. The spectral analysis was performed using equivalent
widths and spectral synthesis. The frequency analysis yielded 10 and 14
intrinsic frequencies for NGC2264VAS20 and NGC2264VAS 87, respectively, in the
range from 0 to 1.5c/d which are attributed to be caused by a combination of
rotation and pulsation. The effective temperatures were derived to be
6380$\pm$150K for NGC2264VAS20 and 6220$\pm$150K for NGC2264VAS87. Membership
of the two stars to the cluster is confirmed independently using X-ray fluxes,
radial velocity measurements and proper motions available in the literature.
The derived Li abundances of log n(Li)=3.34 and 3.54 for NGC2264VAS20 and
NGC2264VAS87, respectively, are in agreement with the Li abundance for other
stars in NGC2264 of similar Teff reported in the literature. We conclude that

obliquity of the star to be \lambda=19+/-15 degrees by modeling the
Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect in Keck/HIRES radial velocities (RVs). The
anomalous RV time series shows an asymmetry relative to the midtransit time,
ordinarily suggesting a nonzero obliquity -- but in this case at least part of
the asymmetry may be due to the convective blueshift, increasing the
uncertainty in the determination of \lambda. We employ the semi-analytical
approach of Hirano et al. (2011) that includes the effects of macroturbulence,
instrumental broadening, and convective blueshift to accurately model the
anomaly in the net RV caused by the planet eclipsing part of the rotating star.
Obliquity measurements are an important tool for testing theories of planet
formation and migration. To date, the measured obliquities of ~50 Jovian
planets span the full range, from prograde to retrograde, with planets orbiting
cool stars preferentially showing alignment of stellar spins and planetary
orbits. Our results are consistent with this pattern emerging from tidal
interactions in the convective envelopes of cool stars and close-in planets. In

a population to vary over time. Discriminating between these two evolutionary
forces, based on a time series of samples from a population, remains an
outstanding problem with increasing relevance to modern data sets. Even in the
idealized situation when the sampled locus is independent of all other loci
this problem is difficult to solve, especially when the size of the population
from which the samples are drawn is unknown. A standard $\chi^2$-based
likelihood ratio test was previously proposed to address this problem. Here we
show that the $\chi^2$ test of selection substantially underestimates the

its $P$-value, especially at stringent $P$-values. We introduce two methods to
correct this bias. The empirical likelihood ratio test (ELRT) rejects
neutrality when the likelihood ratio statistic falls in the tail of the
empirical distribution obtained under the most likely neutral population size.
The frequency increment test (FIT) rejects neutrality if the distribution of
normalized allele frequency increments exhibits a mean that deviates
significantly from zero. We characterize the statistical power of these two
tests for selection, and we apply them to three experimental data sets. We
demonstrate that both ELRT and FIT have power to detect selection in practical
parameter regimes, such as those encountered in microbial evolution
experiments. Our analysis applies to a single diallelic locus, assumed
independent of all other loci, which is most relevant to full-genome selection
scans in sexual organisms, and also to evolution experiments in asexual
organisms as long as clonal interference is weak. Different techniques will be
required to detect selection in time series of co-segregating linked loci.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=3000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Both genetic drift and natural selection cause the frequencies of alleles in\na population to vary over time.

(WMAP) from 2001 to 2008 with measurements taken using Planck from 2009 to

radio sources selected from the Planck Early Release Compact Source Catalogue.
The single-year, single-frequency WMAP maps are used to estimate
yearly-averaged flux densities of the sources in the four WMAP bands: Ka (33
GHz), Q (41 GHz), V (61 GHz), and W (94 GHz). We identify 82, 67, 32, and 15
sources respectively as variable at greater than 99% confidence level in these
four bands. The amplitudes of variation are comparable between bands, and are
not correlated with either the flux densities or the spectral indices of the
sources. The number counts of WMAP Ka-band sources are stable from year to year
despite the fluctuation caused by individual source variability. Most of our
sources show strong correlation in variability between bands. Almost all the
sources that show variability are blazars. We have attempted to fit two simple,
four-parameter models to the time-series of 32 sources showing correlated
variability at multiple frequencies - a long-term flaring model and a
rotating-jet model. We find that 19 sources (60%) can be fit with the simple
rotating-jet model, and ten of these also fit the simple long-term flaring
model. The remaining 13 sources (40%) show more complex variability behaviour

Major I (UMa I), an ultra-faint dwarf satellite recently discovered around the
Milky Way by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Combining time series observations
in the B and V bands from four different telescopes, we have identified seven
RR Lyrae stars in UMa I, of which five are fundamental-mode (RRab) and two are
first-overtone pulsators (RRc). Our V, B-V color-magnitude diagram of UMa I
reaches V~23 mag (at a signal-to-noise ratio of ~ 6) and shows features typical
of a single old stellar population. The mean pulsation period of the RRab stars

classification for the galaxy. The RR Lyrae stars trace the galaxy horizontal
branch at an average apparent magnitude of <V(RR)> = 20.43 +/- 0.02 mag

UMa I of (m-M)0 = 19.94 +/- 0.13 mag, distance d= 97.3 +6.0/-5.7 kpc, in the

the blue border of the instability region. HD 261711 was discovered to be a
pre-main sequence delta Scuti star using the time series photometry obtained by
the MOST satellite in 2006. High-precision, time-series photometry of HD 261711
was obtained by the MOST and CoRoT satellites in 4 separate new observing runs
that are put into context with the star's fundamental atmospheric parameters
obtained from spectroscopy. With the new MOST data set from 2011/12 and the two
CoRoT light curves from 2008 and 2011/12, the delta Scuti variability was
confirmed and regular groups of frequencies were discovered. The two pulsation
frequencies identified in the data from the first MOST observing run in 2006
are confirmed and 23 new delta Scuti-type frequencies were discovered using the
CoRoT data. Weighted average frequencies for each group are related to l=0 and
l=1 p-modes. Evidence for amplitude modulation of the frequencies in two groups
is seen. The effective temperature was derived to be 8600$\pm$200 K, log g is
4.1$\pm$0.2, and the projected rotational velocity is 53$\pm$1km/s. Using our
Teff value and the radius of 1.8$\pm$0.5 Rsun derived from SED fitting, we get

determined values of 1.65 Rsun and, hence, a log L/Lsun of 1.13. The radial
velocity of 14$\pm$2 km/s we derived for HD 261711, confirms the star's
membership to NGC 2264. Our asteroseismic models suggest that HD 261711 is a
delta Scuti-type star close to the zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) with a mass of
1.8 to 1.9Msun. HD 261711 is either a young ZAMS star or a late PMS star just

from two XMM-Newton observations to search for pulsations, characterise the
spectrum, and measure spectral and timing changes. Long-term X-ray variability
was studied using archival ROSAT data. The XMM positions were used to identify
the optical counterpart. We obtained UV to NIR photometry to characterise the
companion, along with its 4000 d long I-band light curve. We observed LXP169

characterised by a power law, was harder when the source was brighter. The
X-ray flux of LXP169 is found to be variable by a factor of at least 10. The
counterpart is highly variable on short and long timescales, and its photometry
is that of an early-type star with a NIR excess. This classifies the source as

SrII, TiII, and CrII were calculated using the Doppler imaging technique. The

introduced for the modeling of decision making among financial agents, in order

amplification of an external signal imposed upon the agents by a mechanism of
resonance. This signal can be interpreted as an advertising or a public
perception in favor or against one of the two possible trading behaviors, thus
periodically breaking the symmetry of the system and acting as a continuously
varying exogenous shock. The conditions for the ensemble of agents to more
accurately follow the periodicity of the signal are studied, finding a maximum

languages are closest to it, without any knowledge of the meaning of the words.
The approach is based on three types of statistical measurements, i.e. obtained
from first-order statistics of word properties in a text, from the topology of
complex networks representing text, and from intermittency concepts where text
is treated as a time series. Comparative experiments were performed with the
New Testament in 15 different languages and with distinct books in English and
Portuguese in order to quantify the dependency of the different measurements on
the language and on the story being told in the book. The metrics found to be
informative in distinguishing real texts from their shuffled versions include
assortativity, degree and selectivity of words. As an illustration, we analyze
an undeciphered medieval manuscript known as the Voynich Manuscript. We show
that it is mostly compatible with natural languages and incompatible with
random texts. We also obtain candidates for key-words of the Voynich Manuscript
which could be helpful in the effort of deciphering it. Because we were able to
identify statistical measurements that are more dependent on the syntax than on
the semantics, the framework may also serve for text analysis in

when it passed at a distance of 27,700 km from the Earth's surface. It was the
first time an asteroid of moderate size was predicted to approach that close to
the Earth, becoming bright enough to permit a detailed study from ground-based
telescopes. Asteroid 2012 DA14 was poorly characterized before its closest
approach. We acquired data using several telescopes on four Spanish
observatories: the 10.4m Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the 3.6m Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo (TNG), both in the El Roque de los Muchachos Observatory
(ORM, La Palma); the 2.2m CAHA telescope, in the Calar Alto Observatory

visible and near-infrared color photometry, visible spectra and time-series
photometry. Visible spectra together with color photometry of 2012 DA14 show
that it can be classified as an L-type asteroid, a rare spectral type with a
composition similar to that of carbonaceous chondrites. The time-series
photometry provides a rotational period of 8.95 +- 0.08 hours after the closest
approach, and there are indications that the object suffered a spin-up during
this event. The large amplitude of the light curve suggests that the object is
very elongated and irregular, with an equivalent diameter of around 18m. We
obtain an absolute magnitude of H_R = 24.5 +- 0.2, corresponding to H_V = 25.0
+- 0.2. The GTC photometry also gives H_V = 25.29 +- 0.14. Both values agree

the absolute photometry, together with some constraints on size and shape, we

can turn `hot'. They start delivering excessive, less predictable, dark
current. The hot pixels need therefore to be flagged so that subsequent
analysis may ignore them. The image data of the PICARD SODISM solar telescope

oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO) time-series for the
time period 1900-2012 in order to investigate plausible manifestation of sharp
increases in temperature.
  It was found that the widely observed warming in the past century did not
occur smoothly but sharply. This fact is more pronounced at the latitude zone
30S - 60N during the years 1925/1926 and 1987/1988. We hypothesise that there
were two major climate regime shifts in 1925/1926 and 1987/1988 years. During
these shifts the mean value of temperature rises, over which natural
variability associated with ENSO, PDO and other factors occurs. During each
sharp increase mean SST in tropics/north middle latitudes increased by about
0.28/0.36 {\deg}C. Most of other temperature anomalies are explained by ENSO
and PDO. The existence of these shifts tends to be masked by natural
variability.

to be caused by rotating starspots on the A component. We model the activity of
this star by deriving maps of the active regions that allow us to study stellar
rotation and the possible interaction with the brown dwarf companion. Methods.
An average transit profile was derived, and the photometric perturbations due
to spots occulted during transits are removed to derive more precise transit
parameters. We applied a maximum entropy spot model to fit the out-of-transit
optical modulation as observed by Kepler during an uninterrupted interval of
500 days. It assumes that stellar active regions consist of cool spots and
bright faculae whose visibility is modulated by stellar rotation. Results.
Thanks to the extended photometric time series, we refine the determination of
the transit parameters and find evidence of spots that are occulted by the
brown dwarf during its transits. The modelling of the out-of-transit light
curve of LHS 6343 A reveals several starspots rotating with a slightly longer
period than the orbital period of the brown dwarf, i.e., 13.13 +- 0.02 days. No
signature attributable to differential rotation is observed. We find evidence
of a persistent active longitude on the M dwarf preceding the sub- companion
point by 100 deg and lasting for at least 500 days. This can be relevant for
understanding how magnetic interaction works in low-mass binary and star-planet
systems.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=3000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Context.

SDSS J103655.39+652252.2 (SDSS J1036+6522). Time-series photometry reveals a

amplitude of 0.442% +/- 0.024%; no other periodic modulations are observed with
amplitudes >~0.13%. The period, amplitude, and phase of this modulation are
constant within errors over 16 months. The spectrum of SDSS J1036+6522 shows
magnetic splitting of carbon lines, and we use Paschen-Back formalism to

optical photometric observations and three X-ray data sets in which we intended
to verify whether the observational properties of the long period modulations

modulation in ordinary IPs. These new optical observations have revealed, for
the first time in photometric data, the variability with the presumed

We also found that the modulations with the precession and orbital periods are
evident in X-ray data. We show that the observed properties of FS Aur closely
resemble those of other intermediate polars, thus confirming this cataclysmic
variable as a member of the class.
  Our analysis of multicolour observations of intermediate polars has shown
that time-series analysis of colour indices appears to be a powerful technique

Hence, understanding
the nature and dynamics of population-wide dietary preferences over time and
space can be valuable in public health. To date, studies have leveraged small
samples of participants via food intake logs or treatment data. We propose a
complementary source of population data on nutrition obtained via Web logs. Our
main contribution is a spatiotemporal analysis of population-wide dietary
preferences through the lens of logs gathered by a widely distributed
Web-browser add-on, using the access volume of recipes that users seek via
search as a proxy for actual food consumption. We discover that variation in
dietary preferences as expressed via recipe access has two main periodic
components, one yearly and the other weekly, and that there exist

component of the RS CVn binary II Peg, the surface of the star was dominated by
one single active longitude that was clearly drifting in the rotational frame
of the binary system during 1994-2002; later imaging for 2004-2010, however,
showed decreased and chaotic spot activity, with no signs of the drift pattern.
Here we set out to investigate from a more extensive photometric dataset
whether such a drift is a persistent phenomenon, in which case it could be due
to either an azimuthal dynamo wave or an indication of the binary system
orbital synchronization still being incomplete. We analyse the datasets using
the Carrier Fit method (hereafter CF), especially suitable for analyzing time
series in which a fast clocking frequency (such as the rotation of the star) is
modulated with a slower process (such as the stellar activity cycle). We
combine all collected photometric data into one single data set, and analyze it
with the CF method. As a result, we confirm the earlier results of the spot
activity having been dominated by one primary spotted region almost through the
entire data set, and the existence of a persistent, nearly linear drift.
Disruptions of the linear trend and complicated phase behavior are also seen,
but the period analysis reveals a rather stable periodicity with
P(spot)=6.71054d plus/minus 0.00005d. After the linear trend is removed from
the data, we identify several abrupt phase jumps, three of which are analyzed

The ability\nto accurately statistically characterize transient confinement suggests new\ntechniques for quantifying confined and/or hop diffusion in complex\nenvironments.'}",[{'name': 'Christopher P.

observed over a 85-d interval at five different sites in North America and

curves of KIC\,6382916 are used to investigate the pulsational content and to
identify the principal modes. High-dispersion spectroscopy was also obtained in

an analysis of the {\it Kepler} time series, three independent frequencies and
a few hundred combination frequencies are found. The light curve is dominated
by two modes with frequencies $f_{1}$= 4.9107 and $f_{2}$= 6.4314\,d$^{-1}$.

attempt mode identification by examining the amplitude ratios and phase
differences in different wavebands from multicolour photometry and comparing
them to calculations for different spherical harmonic degree, $l$. We find that
the theoretical models for $f_1$ and $f_2$ are in a best agreement with the

$f_3$ is uncertain due to its low amplitude. Non-adiabatic pulsation models

three short-period transiting exoplanets, HAT-P-3b, HAT-P-4b and HAT-P-12b, in
both the available 3.6 and 4.5 micron bands. HAT-P-3b and HAT-P-4b are
Jupiter-mass, objects orbiting an early K and an early G dwarf stars,
respectively. For HAT-P-3b we find eclipse depths of 0.112%+0.015%-0.030% (3.6
micron) and 0.094%+0.016%-0.009% (4.5 micron). The HAT-P-4b values are
0.142%+0.014%-0.016% (3.6 micron) and 0.122%+0.012%-0.014% (4.5micron). The two
planets' photometry is consistent with inefficient heat redistribution from
their day to night sides (and low albedos), but it is inconclusive about
possible temperature inversions in their atmospheres. HAT-P-12b is a
Saturn-mass planet and is one of the coolest planets ever observed during
secondary eclipse, along with hot Neptune GJ 436b and hot Saturn WASP-29b. We
are able to place 3$\sigma$ upper limits on the secondary eclipse depth of
HAT-P-12b in both wavelengths: < 0.042% (3.6 micron) and <0.085% (4.5 micron).
We discuss these results in the context of the {\it Spitzer} secondary eclipse
measurements of GJ 436b and WASP-29b. It is possible that we do not detect the
eclipses of HAT-P-12b due to high eccentricity, but find that weak planetary
emission in these wavelengths is a more likely explanation. We place 3 sigma

important field of research in the last years, mainly as a result of advances
in the characterization of dynamical systems from the signals they produce, the
introduction of concepts such as generalized and phase synchronization and the
application of information theory to time series analysis. In neurophysiology,
different analytical tools stemming from these concepts have added to the
'traditional' set of linear methods, which includes the cross-correlation and
the coherency function in the time and frequency domain, respectively, or more
elaborated tools such as Granger Causality. This increase in the number of

geophysical signals are discussed: (1) multidecadal natural oscillations (e.g.
the quasi 60-year Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), North Atlantic
Oscillation (NAO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)) need to be taken into
account for properly quantifying anomalous accelerations in tide gauge records

forcing functions prevent a proper evaluation of the solar contribution to the
20th century global surface temperature warming using overloaded linear
regression models during the 1900-2000 period alone; (3) when periodic wavelet
filters, which require that a record is pre-processed with a reflection
methodology, are improperly applied to decompose non-stationary solar and
climatic time series, Gibbs boundary artifacts emerge yielding misleading
physical interpretations. By correcting these errors and using optimized
regression models that reduce multicollinearity artifacts, I found the

stars has been the subject of active investigation over the past three decades.
Although several solar twins have been found with stellar parameters similar to
those of the Sun (albeit in a range of Li abundances and with somewhat
different compositions), their rotation periods are unknown, except for 18 Sco,
which is younger than the Sun and with a rotation period shorter than solar. It
is difficult to obtain rotation periods for stars of solar age from
ground-based observations, as a low activity level imply a shallow rotational
modulation of their light curves. CoRoT has provided space-based long time
series from which the rotation periods of solar twins as old as the Sun could
be estimated. Based on high S/N high resolution spectroscopic observations
gathered at the Subaru Telescope, we show that the star CoRoT ID 102684698

rotation period is 29 +- 5 days, compatible with its age (6.7 Gyr) and low
lithium content A(Li) < 0.85 dex. Interestingly, our CoRoT solar twin seems to
have enhanced abundances of the refractory elements with respect to the Sun, a
typical characteristic of most nearby twins. With a magnitude V ~14.1, ID

functions for Gaussian processes using genetic programming. A critical aspect
of Gaussian processes and similar kernel-based models such as SVM is, that the
covariance function should be adapted to the modeled data. Frequently, the
squared exponential covariance function is used as a default. However, this can
lead to a misspecified model, which does not fit the data well. In the proposed

featuring a scale-free long-range memory (LRM) response and stochastic forcing
representing the influence on the ocean heat reservoir from atmospheric weather
systems. The model is parametrized by an effective response strength, the
stochastic forcing strength, and the memory exponent. The instrumental global
surface temperature record and the deterministic component of the forcing are
used to estimate these parameters by means of the maximum-likelihood method.
The residual obtained by subtracting the deterministic solution from the
observed record is analyzed as a noise process and shown to be consistent with
a long-memory time-series model and inconsistent with a short-memory model. By
decomposing the forcing record in contributions from solar, volcanic, and
anthropogenic activity one can estimate the contribution of each to 20'th
century global warming. The LRM model is applied with a reconstruction of the
forcing for the last millennium to predict the large-scale features of northern
hemisphere temperature reconstructions, and the analysis of the residual also
clearly favors the LRM model on millennium time scale. The decomposition of the
forcing shows that volcanic aerosols give a considerably greater contribution
to the cooling during the Little Ice Age than the reduction in solar irradiance
associated with the Maunder minimum in solar activity. The LRM model implies a

The model is parametrized by an effective response strength, the\nstochastic forcing strength, and the memory exponent. The instrumental global\nsurface temperature record and the deterministic component of the forcing are\nused to estimate these parameters by means of the maximum-likelihood method.\nThe residual obtained by subtracting the deterministic solution from the\nobserved record is analyzed as a noise process and shown to be consistent with\na long-memory time-series model and inconsistent with a short-memory model. By\ndecomposing the forcing record in contributions from solar, volcanic, and\nanthropogenic activity one can estimate the contribution of each to 20'th\ncentury global warming. The LRM model is applied with a reconstruction of the\nforcing for the last millennium to predict the large-scale features of northern\nhemisphere temperature reconstructions, and the analysis of the residual also\nclearly favors the LRM model on millennium time scale. The decomposition of the\nforcing shows that volcanic aerosols give a considerably greater contribution\nto the cooling during the Little Ice Age than the reduction in solar irradiance\nassociated with the Maunder minimum in solar activity.

parameter of a time series, which is also allowed to be a predictable process

function. Under assumptions on the gain, we derive uniform non-asymptotic error
bounds on the tracking algorithm in terms of chosen step size for the algorithm

gain functions can be constructed. We give several examples of different
variational setups for the parameter process where our result can be applied.

analysis shows that the model is indeed able to reproduce three qualitatively
different traffic phases: free flow (F), synchronized traffic (S), and wide

slope obtained by linear regression of a log-log fluctuation plot against
window size. However, if this fluctuation plot is not linear, then the
underlying signal is not self-similar, and the exponent has no meaning. There
is currently no method for assessing the linearity of a DFA fluctuation plot.

plot to construct a likelihood function for a set of alternative models

use this likelihood function to determine the maximum likelihood and thus to
calculate values of the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria, which
identify the best fit model when the number of parameters involved is taken
into account and over-fitting is penalised. This ensures that, of the models
that fit well, the least complicated is selected as the best fit. We apply
ML-DFA to synthetic data from FARIMA processes and sine curves with DFA
fluctuation plots whose form has been analytically determined, and to

The variability of Solar Spectral Irradiance over the rotational
period and its trend over the solar activity cycle are important for
understanding the Sun-Earth connection as well as for observational constraints
for solar models. Recently the SIM experiment on SORCE has published an
unexpected negative correlation with Total Solar Irradiance of the visible
spectral range. It is compensated by a strong and positive variability of the
near UV range. Aims. We aim to verify whether the anti-correlated
SIM/SORCE-trend in the visible can be confirmed by independent observations of
the VIRGO experiment on SOHO. The challenge of all space experiments measuring
solar irradiance are sensitivity changes of their sensors due to exposure to
intense UV radiation, which are difficult to assess in orbit. Methods. We
analyze a 10-year time series of VIRGO sun photometer data between 2002 and
2012. The variability of Spectral Solar Irradiance is correlated with the
variability of the Total Solar Irradiance, which is taken as a proxy for solar
activity. Results. Observational evidence indicates that after six years only
one single long-term process governs the degradation of the backup sun
photometer in VIRGO which is operated once in a month. This degradation can be
well approximated by a linear function over ten years. The analysis of the
residuals from the linear trend yield robust positive correlations of spectral
irradiance at 862, 500 and 402 nm with total irradiance. In the analysis of
annual averages of these data the positive correlations change into weak
negative correlations, but of little statistical significance, for the 862 nm

distribution in the Bailey diagram. On the other hand, the period distribution

stellar systems. This evidence suggests that the properties of intermediate-age
stellar populations might be affected both by environmental effects and
structural parameters. We use the BV Period--Wesenheit (PW) relation of RRLs

We detected that only two mCP candidates,\n190.1 1581 and 190.1 15527, may show some weak rotationally modulated light\nvariations with periods of 1.23 and 0.49 days; however, the 49% and 32%\nprobabilities of their reality are not very satisfying. The variability of the\nother 10 mCP candidates is too low to be detectable by their V and I OGLE\nphotometry. The relatively low amplitude variability of the studied LMC mCP\ncandidates sample can be explained by the absence of photometric spots of\noverabundant optically active chemical elements. The unexpected LMC mCPs\nbehaviour is probably caused by different conditions during the star formation\nin the LMC and the Galaxy.'}","[{'name': 'E. Paunzen'}, {'name': 'Z. Mikulasek'}, {'name': 'R.

characterize the long-term correlations by waiting times between two subsequent

15\,--\,1000 days by a power-law regime with scaling exponent $\gamma = 2.04$

contrast, a persistent trend is not present in the maximal numbers, although

The degree distribution of the derived\nnetworks for the strong maxima has clear non-Gaussian properties, while the\ndegree distribution for minima is bimodal. The long-term variation of the\ncycles is reflected by hubs in the network which span relatively large time\nintervals. Based on standard network structural measures, we propose to\ncharacterize the long-term correlations by waiting times between two subsequent\nevents. The persistence range of the solar cycles has been identified over\n15\\,--\\,1000 days by a power-law regime with scaling exponent $\\gamma = 2.04$\nof the occurrence time of the two subsequent and successive strong minima. In\ncontrast, a persistent trend is not present in the maximal numbers, although\nmaxima do have significant deviations from an exponential form. Our results\nsuggest some new insights for evaluating existing models. The power-law regime\nsuggested by the waiting times does indicate that there are some level of\npredictable patterns in the minima.'}","[{'name': 'Yong Zou'}, {'name': 'Michael Small'}, {'name': 'Zonghua Liu'}, {'name': 'Jürgen Kurths'}]",{'name': 'Jürgen Kurths'},Jürgen Kurths,10.1088/1367-2630/16/1/013051,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/16/1/013051', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6280v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.6280v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'physics.data-an', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'physics.data-an', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.IM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'nlin.CD', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,"18 pages, 11 figures.

  This paper presents financial examples in which we learn from data and then
proceed to classify fresh streams. The classification is based on features of
streams that are specified through the coordinates of the signature of the
path. At a mathematical level the signature is a faithful transform of a
multidimensional time series. (Ben Hambly and Terry Lyons \cite{uniqueSig}),
Hao Ni and Terry Lyons \cite{NiLyons} introduced the possibility of its use to
understand financial data and pointed to the potential this approach has for
machine learning and prediction.
  We evaluate and refine these theoretical suggestions against practical
examples of interest and present a few motivating experiments which demonstrate
information the signature can easily capture in a non-parametric way avoiding
traditional statistical modelling of the data. In the first experiment we
identify atypical market behaviour across standard 30-minute time buckets

duty cycle of the transit signal, and thus the optimal frequency sampling is

considering duty-cycle dependent binning of the phased light curve. By using
the (standard) BLS one is either rather insensitive to long-period planets, or
less sensitive to short-period planets and computationally slower by a

evidence for planetary-induced forcing and modulation of solar activity. Power
spectra and direct data pattern analysis reveal a clear signature of the
1.09-year Earth-Jupiter conjunction cycle, in particular during solar cycle 23
maximum. This appears to suggest that the Jupiter side of the Sun is slightly
brighter during solar maxima. The effect is observed when the Earth crosses the
Sun-Jupiter conjunction line every 1.09 years. Multiple spectral peaks are
observed in the TSI records that are coherent with known planetary harmonics
such as the spring, orbital and synodic periods among Mercury, Venus, Earth and
Jupiter: the Mercury-Venus spring-tidal cycle (0.20 year); the Mercury orbital
cycle (0.24 year); the Venus-Jupiter spring-tidal cycle (0.32 year); the
Venus-Mercury synodic cycle (0.40 year); the Venus-Jupiter synodic cycle (0.65

also found for a 0.5-year TSI cycle that could be driven by the Earth's
crossing the solar equatorial plane twice a year and may indicate a latitudinal
solar-luminosity asymmetry. Because both spring and synodic planetary cycles
appear to be present and the amplitudes of their TSI signatures appear enhanced
during sunspot cycle maxima, we conjecture that on annual and sub-annual scales
both gravitational and electro-magnetic planet-sun interactions and internal

We confirm the previous finding that\nlocal maxima in profit landscapes are scattered in a fractal-like fashion: The\nnumber M of local maxima follows the power-law form $M \\sim N^{a}$, but the\nscaling exponent $a$ is found to differ for different time series. From\ncomparisons of real and artificial stock prices, we find that the fat-tailed\nreturn distribution is closely related to the exponent $a \\approx 1.6$ observed\nfor real stock markets. We suggest that the fractality of profit landscape\ncharacterized by $a \\approx 1.6$ can be a useful measure to validate time\nseries model for stock prices.'}","[{'name': 'Il Gu Yi'}, {'name': 'Gabjin Oh'}, {'name': 'Beom Jun Kim'}]",{'name': 'Beom Jun Kim'},Beom Jun Kim,10.1140/epjb/e2013-31116-3,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1140/epjb/e2013-31116-3', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.1749v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.1749v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'q-fin.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'q-fin.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'q-fin.TR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,"10pages, 6figures","Eur.

valuable for working with time series which contain large numbers of cycles at

accurate reduced-order model that can be used as a surrogate for the
true/fiducial waveform family. First, a set of m parameter values is determined
using a greedy algorithm from which a reduced basis representation is
constructed. Second, these m parameters induce the selection of m time values
for interpolating a waveform time series using an empirical interpolant. Third,
a fit in the parameter dimension is performed for the waveform's value at each
of these m times. The cost of predicting L waveform time samples for a generic
parameter choice is of order m L + m c_f online operations where c_f denotes
the fitting function operation count and, typically, m << L. We generate
accurate surrogate models for Effective One Body (EOB) waveforms of

mass ratios from 1 to 10, and for multiple harmonic modes. We find that these
surrogates are three orders of magnitude faster to evaluate as compared to the

other waveform models follow the same steps and have the same low online
scaling cost. For expensive numerical simulations of binary black hole
coalescences we thus anticipate large speedups in generating new waveforms with

spatio-temporal point process model for individual-level data and a
multivariate time-series model for aggregated count data. In both frameworks, a
power-law decay of spatial interaction is embedded into the epidemic component

likelihood inference. Whereas the power law can be based on Euclidean distance

where the power law depends on the order of the neighbourhood of discrete
spatial units. The performance of the new approach is investigated by a

provides information about character of potential multifractality in

zones. These planets may provide our best chance to detect bio-markers on a
transiting exoplanet, thanks to the diminished contrast ratio between the
Earth-sized WD and its Earth-sized planets. The JWST is capable of obtaining
the first spectroscopic measurements of such planets, yet there are no known
planets around WDs. Here we propose to take advantage of the unique capability
of the Kepler spacecraft in the 2-Wheels mode to perform a transit survey that
is capable of identifying the first planets in the habitable zone of a WD. We
propose to obtain Kepler time-series photometry of 10,000 WDs in the SDSS
imaging area to search for planets in the habitable zone. Thanks to the large
field of view of Kepler, for the first time in history, a large number of WDs
can be observed at the same time, which is essential for discovering transits.
Our proposed survey requires a total of 200 days of observing time, and will
find up to 100 planets in the WD habitable zone. This survey will maintain
Kepler's spirit of searching for habitable Earths, but near new hosts. With
few-day observations and minute-cadences per field, it will also open up a
completely unexplored discovery space. In addition to planets, this survey is
sensitive to pulsating WDs, as well as eclipsing short period stellar and
substellar companions. These have important implications for constraining the
double WD merger rate and their contribution to Type Ia supernovae and the
gravitational wave foreground. Given the relatively low number density of our
targets, this program can be combined with other projects that would benefit
from high cadence and many-fields observations with Kepler, e.g. a transit
survey of a magnitude-limited, complete sample of nearby M dwarfs or
asteroseismology of variable stars (e.g. RR Lyrae) in the same fields.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=3000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""A large fraction of white dwarfs (WDs) may host planets in their habitable\nzones.

useful representations from samples of a dataset in an unsupervised fashion.
They have been widely employed as an unsupervised pre-training method in
machine learning. RBMs have been modified to model time series in two main
ways: The Temporal RBM stacks a number of RBMs laterally and introduces
temporal dependencies between the hidden layer units; The Conditional RBM, on
the other hand, considers past samples of the dataset as a conditional bias and
learns a representation which takes these into account. Here we propose a new
training method for both the TRBM and the CRBM, which enforces the dynamic
structure of temporal datasets. We do so by treating the temporal models as
denoising autoencoders, considering past frames of the dataset as corrupted
versions of the present frame and minimizing the reconstruction error of the
present data by the model. We call this approach Temporal Autoencoding. This
leads to a significant improvement in the performance of both models in a
filling-in-frames task across a number of datasets. The error reduction for
motion capture data is 56\% for the CRBM and 80\% for the TRBM. Taking the
posterior mean prediction instead of single samples further improves the
model's estimates, decreasing the error by as much as 91\% for the CRBM on
motion capture data. We also trained the model to perform forecasting on a
large number of datasets and have found TA pretraining to consistently improve
the performance of the forecasts. Furthermore, by looking at the prediction

days, the distribution levels off showing discrete peaks at common coherency
scales. In addition, by organizing the transient coherency scale distributions

is bi-modal with a peak at short (< 10 days) and long (> 250 days) periods.
Observationally, many short-period sdB systems are known, but the predicted
long period peak is missing as orbits have only been determined for a few
long-period systems. As these predictions are based on poorly understood
binary-interaction processes, it is of prime importance to confront the
predictions with reliable observational data. We therefore initiated a
monitoring program to find and characterize long-period sdB stars. In this
paper we aim to determine the orbital parameters of the three long-period
sdB+MS binaries BD+29 3070, BD+34 1543 and Feige 87, to constrain their
absolute dimensions and the physical parameters of the components.
High-resolution spectroscopic time series were obtained with HERMES at the
Mercator telescope on La Palma, and analyzed to determine the radial velocities
of both the sdB and MS components. Photometry from the literature was used to
construct the spectral-energy distribution (SED) of the binaries. Atmosphere
models were used to fit these SEDs and to determine the surface gravities and
temperatures of both components of all systems. Spectral analysis was used to
check the results of the SEDs. An orbital period of 1283 +- 63 d, a mass ratio
of q = 0.39 +- 0.04 and a significant non-zero eccentricity of e = 0.15 +- 0.01
were found for BD+29 3070. For BD+34 1543 we determined P = 972 +- 2 d, q =
0.57 +- 0.01 and again a clear non-zero eccentricity of e = 0.16 +- 0.01. Last,
for Feige 87 we found P = 936 +- 2 d, q = 0.55 +- 0.01 and e = 0.11 +- 0.01.

telescope of the AAVSONet. From the observed light curves, 92 pulsation maxima
have been measured covering about six Blazhko periods. The Fourier analysis of
magnitudes at maximum light has revealed a main Blazhko period of 77.6 days and
also a secondary period of 40.5 days. A Fourier analysis of (O-C) values did
not show the secondary Blazhko period. The frequency spectrum of the complete
light curve, from a Fourier analysis and successive pre-whitening with
PERIOD04, has shown triplet structures around the two Blazhko modulation
frequencies but with slightly different periods (77.8 and 42.4 days). The
second Blazhko frequency is statistically not a harmonic of the main Blazhko
frequency. Besides the two Blazhko modulations KV Cnc presents other
particularities like irregularities from Blazhko cycle to cycle and very fast
magnitude variations which can reach a maximum of 2.5 magnitudes per hour over
a period of 15 minutes. This campaign shows that regular observations by
amateur astronomers remain important. Indeed such a detailed characterization

in reactive processes. The phase space of the variables (concentrations in
reactive systems) is partitioned into a finite number of segments, which
constitute the nodes of the abstract network. Transitions between the nodes are
dictated by the dynamics of the reactive process and provide the links between
the nodes. These are weighted networks, since each link weight reflects the
transition rate between the corresponding states-nodes. With this construction
the network properties mirror the dynamics of the underlying process and one
can investigate the system properties by studying the corresponding abstract
network. As a working example the Lattice Limit Cycle (LLC) model is used. Its
corresponding abstract network is constructed and the transition matrix
elements are computed via Kinetic (Dynamic) Monte Carlo simulations. For this
model it is shown that the degree distribution follows a power law with
exponent -1, while the average clustering coefficient $c(N)$ scales with the
network size (number of nodes) $N$ as $c(N)\sim N^{-\nu}, \nu \simeq 1.46$. The
computed exponents classify the LLC abstract reactive network into the
scale-free networks. This conclusion corroborates earlier investigations
demonstrating the formation of fractal spatial patterns in LLC reactive
dynamics due to stochasticity and to the clustering of homologous species. The

The phase space of the variables (concentrations in\nreactive systems) is partitioned into a finite number of segments, which\nconstitute the nodes of the abstract network. Transitions between the nodes are\ndictated by the dynamics of the reactive process and provide the links between\nthe nodes. These are weighted networks, since each link weight reflects the\ntransition rate between the corresponding states-nodes. With this construction\nthe network properties mirror the dynamics of the underlying process and one\ncan investigate the system properties by studying the corresponding abstract\nnetwork. As a working example the Lattice Limit Cycle (LLC) model is used. Its\ncorresponding abstract network is constructed and the transition matrix\nelements are computed via Kinetic (Dynamic) Monte Carlo simulations. For this\nmodel it is shown that the degree distribution follows a power law with\nexponent -1, while the average clustering coefficient $c(N)$ scales with the\nnetwork size (number of nodes) $N$ as $c(N)\\sim N^{-\\nu}, \\nu \\simeq 1.46$. The\ncomputed exponents classify the LLC abstract reactive network into the\nscale-free networks. This conclusion corroborates earlier investigations\ndemonstrating the formation of fractal spatial patterns in LLC reactive\ndynamics due to stochasticity and to the clustering of homologous species.

Urban land use types
can be differentiated either by their physical characteristics (such as
reflectivity and texture) or social functions. Remote sensing techniques have
been recognized as a vital method for urban land use classification because of
their ability to capture the physical characteristics of land use. Although
significant progress has been achieved in remote sensing methods designed for
urban land use classification, most techniques focus on physical
characteristics, whereas knowledge of social functions is not adequately used.
Owing to the wide usage of mobile phones, the activities of residents, which
can be retrieved from the mobile phone data, can be determined in order to
indicate the social function of land use. This could bring about the
opportunity to derive land use information from mobile phone data. To verify
the application of this new data source to urban land use classification, we
first construct a time series of aggregated mobile phone data to characterize
land use types. This time series is composed of two aspects: the hourly
relative pattern, and the total call volume. A semi-supervised fuzzy c-means
clustering approach is then applied to infer the land use types. The method is
validated using mobile phone data collected in Singapore. Land use is
determined with a detection rate of 58.03%. An analysis of the land use
classification results shows that the accuracy decreases as the heterogeneity
of land use increases, and increases as the density of cell phone towers
increases.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=3000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Land use classification is essential for urban planning.

The spatio-temporal covariance functions, obtained here are\nfunctions of the spatial distance and the temporal frequency and are similar to\nMatern class. These are in terms of modified Bessel functions of the second\nkind. and the parameters are in terms of the second order spectral density\nfunctions of the random proces and the spatial distances. We consider the\nestimation of the parameters of the covariance function and also briefly\nmention their asymptotic properties. The estimation of the entire data at a\nknown location, and also the estimation of a value given the above sample is\nalso considered. The predictors are obtained using the vectors of Discrete\nFourier Transforms. We also describe a statistical test for testing the\nindependence of the m spatial time series (testing for spatial independence)\nusing the Finite Fourier Transforms and it is based on the likelihood ratio\ntest of complex valued random variables The methods are illustrated with real\ndata.\n  Keywords: Discrete Fourier Transforms, Covariance functions, Spectral density\nfunctions, Space-Time Processses, Prediction(kriging) Laplacian operators,\nFrequency Variogram, Tests for independence, Whittle likelihood.'}","[{'name': 'T.

model-based clustering of categorical time series assuming a fixed number of

example, the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), turned out to have severe
problems in the categorical time series context.
  In this paper, we circumvent the difficulties of choosing the number of
clusters by adopting the Bayesian semiparametric mixture model approach
introduced by Bhattacharya (2008), who assume that the number of clusters is a
random quantity, but is bounded above by a (possibly large) number of clusters.
We adopt the perfect simulation approach of Mukhopadhyay and Bhattacharya
(2012) for posterior simulation for completely solving the problems of
convergence of the underlying Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach.
Importantly, within our main perfect simulation algorithm, there arose the
necessity to simulate perfectly from the joint distribution of a set of
continuous random variables with log-concave full conditional densities. We
propose and develop a novel and efficient perfect simulation methodology for
joint distributions with log-concave full conditionals. This perfect sampling
methodology is of independent interest as well since in a very large and
important class of Bayesian applications the full conditionals turn out to be
log-concave.

Digital Signal Processing (DSP) using Support Vector Machines (SVMs). The use
of SVMs in estimation problems has been traditionally limited to its mere use
as a black-box model. Noting such limitations in the literature, we take
advantage of several properties of Mercer's kernels and functional analysis to
develop a family of SVM methods for estimation in DSP. Three types of signal
model equations are analyzed. First, when a specific time-signal structure is
assumed to model the underlying system that generated the data, the linear
signal model (so called Primal Signal Model formulation) is first stated and
analyzed. Then, non-linear versions of the signal structure can be readily
developed by following two different approaches. On the one hand, the signal
model equation is written in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) using the
well-known RKHS Signal Model formulation, and Mercer's kernels are readily used
in SVM non-linear algorithms. On the other hand, in the alternative and not so
common Dual Signal Model formulation, a signal expansion is made by using an
auxiliary signal model equation given by a non-linear regression of each time
instant in the observed time series. These building blocks can be used to
generate different novel SVM-based methods for problems of signal estimation,
and we deal with several of the most important ones in DSP. We illustrate the
usefulness of this methodology by defining SVM algorithms for linear and
non-linear system identification, spectral analysis, nonuniform interpolation,
sparse deconvolution, and array processing. The performance of the developed
SVM methods is compared to standard approaches in all these settings. The

analysing systems use explicit time plane features for cardiac pattern

performed by using the so-called Partial Directed Coherence. This measure is
usually evaluated by first identifying a multivariate autoregressive model, and
then by using Fourier transforms of the impulse responses identified and
applying appropriate normalizations. Here, we present another route to evaluate
the partial directed coherences in multivariate time series. The method
proposed is non parametric, and utilises the strong spectral factorization of
the inverse of the spectral density matrix of the multivariate process. To
perform the factorization, we have recourse to an algorithm developed by Davis
and his collaborators. We present simulations as well as an application on a
real data set (Local Field Potentials in the sleeping mouse) to illustrate the

Course (MOOC) provider during the summer of 2013. Since social learning is a
key element of scalable education in MOOCs and is done via online discussion
forums, our main focus is in understanding forum activities. Two salient
features of MOOC forum activities drive our research: 1. High decline rate: for
all courses studied, the volume of discussions in the forum declines
continuously throughout the duration of the course. 2. High-volume, noisy
discussions: at least 30% of the courses produce new discussion threads at
rates that are infeasible for students or teaching staff to read through.
Furthermore, a substantial portion of the discussions are not directly
course-related.
  We investigate factors that correlate with the decline of activity in the
online discussion forums and find effective strategies to classify threads and
rank their relevance. Specifically, we use linear regression models to analyze
the time series of the count data for the forum activities and make a number of
observations, e.g., the teaching staff's active participation in the discussion
increases the discussion volume but does not slow down the decline rate. We
then propose a unified generative model for the discussion threads, which
allows us both to choose efficient thread classifiers and design an effective
algorithm for ranking thread relevance. Our ranking algorithm is further
compared against two baseline algorithms, using human evaluation from Amazon
Mechanical Turk.

relevant to the modeling of thermoacoustic coupling in reactive flows: a
compact acoustic source, an empirical model for the heat source, and
nonlinearities. This thermo-acoustic system features a complex dynamical
behavior. In order to synthesize accurate time-series, we tackle this problem
from a numerical point-of-view, and start by proposing a dedicated solver
designed for dealing with the underlying stiffness, in particular, the retarded
time and the discontinuity at the location of the heat source. Stability
analysis is performed on the limit of low-amplitude disturbances by means of
the projection method proposed by Jarlebring (2008), which alleviates the
linearization with respect to the retarded time. The results are then compared
to the analytical solution of the undamped system, and to Galerkin projection
methods commonly used in this setting. This analysis provides insight into the
consequences of the various assumptions and simplifications that justify the
use of Galerkin expansions based on the eigenmodes of the unheated resonator.
We illustrate that due to the presence of a discontinuity in the spatial
domain, the eigenmodes in the heated case, predicted by using Galerkin
expansion, show spurious oscillations resulting from the Gibbs phenomenon. By
comparing the modes of the linear to that of the nonlinear regime, we are able
to illustrate the mean-flow modulation and frequency switching. Finally,
time-series in the fully nonlinear regime, where a limit cycle is established,
are analyzed and dominant modes are extracted. The analysis of the saturated

quiescent and flaring states. Since this active star is near the
fully-convective boundary, to study in detail its long-term chromospheric
activity could be an appreciable contribution for the dynamo theory. Here, we
analyze with the Lomb-Scargle periodogram the Ca II K line-core fluxes derived
from CASLEO spectra obtained between 2001 and 2013 and the V magnitude from the
ASAS database between 2004 and 2010. From both totally independent time-series,
we obtain a possible activity cycle of period $\sim7$ years and a
less-significant shorter one of $\sim2$ years. A tentative interpretation is
that a dynamo operating near the surface could be generating the longer cycle,
while a second dynamo operating in the deep convection zone could be
responsible for the shorter one. Based on the long duration of our observing
program at CASLEO and the fact that we observe simultaneously different

Recent discoveries of variable L/T transition dwarfs argued for patchy clouds
in at least some ultracool atmospheres. This study aims to measure the
frequency and level of spectral variability in brown dwarfs and to search for
correlations with spectral type. We used HST/WFC3 to obtain spectroscopic time
series for 22 brown dwarfs of spectral types ranging from L5 to T6 at 1.1-1.7
$\mu$m for $\approx$40 min per object. Using Bayesian analysis, we find 6 brown
dwarfs with confident $(p>95\%)$ variability in the relative flux in at least
one wavelength region at sub-percent precision, and 5 brown dwarfs with
tentative $(p>68\%)$ variability. We derive a minimum variability fraction
$f_{min}=27^{+11}_{-7}\%$ over all covered spectral types. The fraction of
variables is equal within errors for mid L, late L and mid T spectral types;
for early T dwarfs we do not find any confident variable but the sample is too
small to derive meaningful limits. For some objects, the variability occurs
primarily in the flux peak in the J or H band, others are variable throughout
the spectrum or only in specific absorption regions. Four sources may have
broad-band peak-to-peak amplitudes exceeding 1%. Our measurements are not
sensitive to very long periods, inclinations near pole-on and rotationally
symmetric heterogeneity. The detection statistics are consistent with most
brown dwarf photospheres being patchy. While multiple-percent near-infrared

that cardiorespiratory system is engaged in weakly synchronized dynamics with a
very specific temporal patterning of synchrony: the oscillations go out of
synchrony frequently, but return to the synchronous state very quickly (usually
within just one cycle of oscillations). Properties of synchrony depended on the
age and disease status. Healthy subjects exhibited more synchrony at the higher

We concentrate on three main approaches to measuring causality: linear Granger
causality, kernel generalisations of Granger causality (based on ridge
regression and the Hilbert--Schmidt norm of the cross-covariance operator) and
transfer entropy, examining each method and comparing their theoretical
properties, with special attention given to the ability to capture nonlinear
causality. We also present the theoretical benefits of applying non-symmetrical
measures rather than symmetrical measures of dependence. We apply the measures
to a range of simulated and real data. The simulated data sets were generated
with linear and several types of nonlinear dependence, using bivariate, as well

systems in terms of information transfer, storage and modification. Especially
the measure of information transfer, transfer entropy, has seen a dramatic
surge of interest in neuroscience. Estimating transfer entropy from two
processes requires the observation of multiple realizations of these processes
to estimate associated probability density functions. To obtain these
observations, available estimators assume stationarity of processes to allow
pooling of observations over time. This assumption however, is a major obstacle
to the application of these estimators in neuroscience as observed processes
are often non-stationary. As a solution, Gomez-Herrero and colleagues
theoretically showed that the stationarity assumption may be avoided by
estimating transfer entropy from an ensemble of realizations. Such an ensemble
is often readily available in neuroscience experiments in the form of
experimental trials. Thus, in this work we combine the ensemble method with a
recently proposed transfer entropy estimator to make transfer entropy
estimation applicable to non-stationary time series. We present an efficient
implementation of the approach that deals with the increased computational
demand of the ensemble method's practical application. In particular, we use a

data collected by the ASM and PCA detectors aboard the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer. A cross-correlation analysis reveals an X-ray lag of ~2 weeks.
Motivated by this result, we develop a model that reproduces the complex OIR
light curves of LMC X-3. The model is comprised of three components of
emission: stellar light; accretion luminosity from the outer disk inferred from
the time-lagged X-ray emission; and light from the X-ray-heated star and outer
disk. Using the model, we filter a strong noise component out of the
ellipsoidal light curves and derive an improved orbital period for the system.
Concerning accretion physics, we find that the local viscous timescale in the
disk increases with the local mass accretion rate; this in turn implies that
the viscosity parameter alpha decreases with increasing luminosity. Finally, we
find that X-ray heating is a strong function of X-ray luminosity below ~50% of
the Eddington limit, while above this limit X-ray heating is heavily
suppressed. We ascribe this behavior to the strong dependence of the flaring in
the disk upon X-ray luminosity, concluding that for luminosities above ~50% of

hyper-differential filter as a means of increasing the accuracy of the AD-LES
model without increasing the computational cost. Box filters, Pad\'{e} filters,

is tested in the numerical simulation of the three-dimensional Taylor-Green

simulation (DNS) data. An under-resolved numerical simulation is also used for
comparison purposes. Four criteria are used to investigate the AD-LES model
equipped with these spatial filters: (i) the time series of the volume-averaged
enstrophy; (ii) the volume-averaged third-order structure function; (iii) the
$L^2$-norm of the velocity and vorticity errors; and (iv) the volume-averaged

the numerical results yield the following two conclusions: first, the AD-LES

information using electronic tunneling transverse to the single-stranded DNA

original sequencing by tunneling method, in which $N$ pairs of electrodes are
built in series along a synthetic nanochannel. While the ssDNA is forced
through the channel using a longitudinal field it passes by each pair of
electrodes for long enough time to gather a minimum of $m$ tunneling current
measurements, where $m$ is determined by the level of sequencing error desired.
Each current time series for each nucleobase is then cross-correlated together,
from which the DNA bases can be distinguished. We show using random sampling of
data from classical molecular dynamics, that indeed the sequencing error is
significantly reduced as the number of pairs of electrodes, $N$, increases.
Compared to the sequencing ability of a single pair of electrodes,
cross-correlating $N$ pairs of electrodes is exponentially better due to the
approximate log-normal nature of the tunneling current probability
distributions. We have also used the Fenton-Wilkinson approximation to
analytically describe the mean and variance of the cross-correlations that are

observing cadence with statistically meaningful classification probabilities.
We have analyzed the WISE light curves of 8273 variable stars identified in
previous optical variability surveys (MACHO, GCVS, and ASAS) and show that
Fourier decomposition techniques can be extended into the mid-IR to assist with
their classification. Combined with other periodic light-curve features, this
sample is then used to train a machine-learned classifier based on the random
forest (RF) method. Consistent with previous classification studies of variable
stars in general, the RF machine-learned classifier is superior to other
methods in terms of accuracy, robustness against outliers, and relative
immunity to features that carry little or redundant class information. For the
three most common classes identified by WISE: Algols, RR Lyrae, and W Ursae

domain astrophysics, and includes supporting high-resolution spectroscopy from
the Southern Astrophysical Research Telescope, Kitt Peak National Observatory,

interpret the strength and timing of fluctuations in the light curve as
interactions between fast-moving ejecta and an inhomogeneous CSM produced by
past eruptions of this massive luminous blue variable (LBV) star. Our time
series of spectroscopy in 2012 reveals that, as the continuum and narrow
H-alpha flux from CSM interactions declines, the broad component of H-alpha
persists with SN-like velocities that are not typically seen in LBVs or SN
Impostor events. At late times we find that SN 2009ip continues to decline
slowly, at <0.01 magnitudes per day, with small fluctuations in slope similar
to Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) or SN impostors, but no further LBV-like
activity. The late time spectrum features broad calcium lines similar to both
late time SNe and SN Impostors. In general, we find that the photometric and
spectroscopic evolution of SN 2009ip is more similar to SNe IIn than either

observed an active region on 11 July 2012, which exhibits several interesting

solar activity reconstruction based on the cosmogenic radionuclide 10Be

nonlinear dynamics, the solar activity cycle is studied using solar activity
proxies that have been reaching into the past for over 9300 years. The
complexity of the system is expressed by several parameters of nonlinear
dynamics, such as embedding dimension or false nearest neighbors, and the
method of delay coordinates is applied to the time series. We also fit a damped
random walk model, which accurately describes the variability of quasars, to
the solar 10Be data and investigate the corresponding power spectral
distribution. The periods in the data series were searched by the Fourier and
wavelet analyses. The solar activity on the long-term scale is found to be on
the edge of chaotic behavior. This can explain the observed intermittent period
of longer lasting solar activity minima. Filtering the data by eliminating
variations below a certain period (the periods of 380 yr and 57 yr were used)

J093010.78+533859.5, for which the doubly eclips- ing feature had been detected
previously from the SuperWASP photometric archive. Individual PSF photometry
for two objects with a separation of about 1.9 arcsec was performed for the
first time in this study. Our time-series photometric data confirms the finding
of Lohr et al. (2013) that the bright object A is an Algol-type detached
eclipsing binary and the fainter B is a W UMa-type contact eclipsing. Using the
high- resolution optical spectra, we obtained well-defined radial velocity
variations of system A. Furthermore, stationary spectral lines were detected
that must have originated from a further, previously unrecognized stellar
component. It was confirmed by the third object contribution from the light
curve analysis. No spectral feature of the system B was detected, probably due
to motion blur by long exposure time. We obtained the binary parameters and the
absolute dimensions of the systems A and B from light curve synthesis with and
without radial velocities, respectively. The primary and secondary components
of system A have a spectral type of K1 and K5 main sequences, respec- tively.
Two components of system B have nearly the same type of K3 main sequence. Light
variations for both binaries are satisfactorily modeled by using two-spot
models with one starspot on each component. We estimated the distances to
systems A and B individually. Two systems may have similar distances of about
70 pc and seem to be gravitationally bound with a separation of about 130 AU.

measurements are available, is the estimation of the intra-system causal
relations. For instance, electric cortical signals are used for studying
functional connectivity between brain areas, their directionality, the direct
or indirect nature of the connections, and the spectral characteristics (e.g.
which oscillations are preferentially transmitted). The earliest spectral
measure of causality was Akaike's (1968) seminal work on the noise contribution
ratio, reflecting direct and indirect connections. Later, a major breakthrough
was the partial directed coherence of Baccala and Sameshima (2001) for direct
connections. The simple aim of this study consists of two parts: (1) To expose
a major problem with the partial directed coherence, where it is shown that it
is affected by irrelevant connections to such an extent that it can
misrepresent the frequency response, thus defeating the main purpose for which
the measure was developed, and (2) To provide a solution to this problem,
namely the ""isolated effective coherence"", which consists of estimating the
partial coherence under a multivariate auto-regressive model, followed by
setting all irrelevant associations to zero, other than the particular
directional association of interest. Simple, realistic, toy examples illustrate
the severity of the problem with the partial directed coherence, and the
solution achieved by the isolated effective coherence. For the sake of

series. It is applied to main-sequence late-type stars whose optical flux

used to select stars that allow an accurate determination of starspot rotation
periods. A simple two-spot model was applied together with a Bayesian
information criterion to preliminarily select intervals of the time series
showing evidence of differential rotation with starspots of almost constant
area. Finally, the significance of the differential rotation detection and a
measurement of its amplitude and uncertainty were obtained by an a posteriori
Bayesian analysis based on a Monte Carlo Markov Chain approach. We applied our
method to the Sun and eight other stars for which previous spot modelling had
been performed to compare our results with previous ones. We find that
autocorrelation is a simple method for selecting stars with a coherent
rotational signal that is a prerequisite for successfully measuring
differential rotation through spot modelling. For a proper Monte Carlo Markov
Chain analysis, it is necessary to take the strong correlations among different
parameters that exist in spot modelling into account. For the planet-hosting

Random Forest is our classifier of choice since it is one of the\nmost accurate learning algorithms available. Our training set consists of 873\nvariable sources and their features are derived from time series, spectra, and\nother multi-wavelength contextual information. The 10-fold cross validation\naccuracy of the training data is ${\\sim}$97% on a seven-class data set. We\napplied the trained classification model to 411 unknown variable 2XMM sources\nto produce a probabilistically classified catalog. Using the classification\nmargin and the Random Forest derived outlier measure, we identified 12\nanomalous sources, of which, 2XMM J180658.7$-$500250 appears to be the most\nunusual source in the sample. Its X-ray spectra is suggestive of a ULX but its\nvariability makes it highly unusual. Machine-learned classification and anomaly\ndetection will facilitate scientific discoveries in the era of all-sky surveys.'}","[{'name': 'Kitty K.

index) for a statistical property known as detailed balance. The presence of
detailed balance would imply that the market can be modeled by a stochastic
process based on a Markov chain, thus leading to equilibrium. In economic
terms, a positive outcome of the test would support the efficient market
hypothesis, a cornerstone of neo-classical economic theory. In contrast to the
usage in prevalent economic theory the term equilibrium here is tied to the
returns, rather than the price time series. The test is based on an action
functional $S$ constructed from the elements of the detailed balance condition

possible to monitor genomes in great detail. New experiments not only use HTS
to measure genomic features at one time point but to monitor them changing over
time with the aim of identifying significant changes in their abundance. In
population genetics, for example, allele frequencies are monitored over time to
detect significant frequency changes that indicate selection pressures.
Previous attempts at analysing data from HTS experiments have been limited as
they could not simultaneously include data at intermediate time points,
replicate experiments and sources of uncertainty specific to HTS such as
sequencing depth.
  Results: We present the beta-binomial Gaussian process (BBGP) model for
ranking features with significant non-random variation in abundance over time.
The features are assumed to represent proportions, such as proportion of an
alternative allele in a population. We use the beta-binomial model to capture
the uncertainty arising from finite sequencing depth and combine it with a
Gaussian process model over the time series. In simulations that mimic the
features of experimental evolution data, the proposed method clearly
outperforms classical testing in average precision of finding selected alleles.
We also present simulations exploring different experimental design choices and
results on real data from Drosophila experimental evolution experiment in
temperature adaptation.

years. We assess the variability using linewidth measurements and the time
series of line profiles. All objects show gradual, slow profile changes on
time-scales of days. In addition, in three cases there is evidence for rapid
variations in H{\alpha} with typical time-scales of 10 min, which occurs in 10%

from the line fluxes,are 0.01-0.07 dex for time-scales of < 1 hour, 0.04-0.4

intermediate (days) variability dominated over longer (years) variability. Here
our new results, based on much higher cadence observations, also provide a
lower limit to accretion-rate variability on similar time-scales (days),
thereby constraining the accretion rate variability physics in a much more
definitive way. A plausible explanation for the gradual variations over days is
an asymmetric accretion flow resulting in a rotational modulation of the
accretion-related emission, although other interpretations are possible as
well. In conjunction with our previous work, we find that the time-scales and

At best, the lack of a standard metadata schema makes it unnecessarily\ntime-consuming to write software to process multiple datasets and, at worse,\nthe lack of a standard means that crucial information is simply absent from\nsome datasets. We propose a metadata schema for representing appliances,\nmeters, buildings, datasets, prior knowledge about appliances and appliance\nmodels.

series have been affected during the recent financial crises. In particular we
focus on changes associated with the remarkable economic events of the last two
decades in the mean and volatility dynamics, including the underlying
volatility persistence and volatility spillovers structure. Using daily data
from several key stock market indices we find that stock market returns exhibit
time varying persistence in their corresponding conditional variances.
Furthermore, the results of our bivariate GARCH models show the existence of
time varying correlations as well as time varying shock and volatility
spillovers between the returns of FTSE and DAX, and those of NIKKEI and Hang
Seng, which became more prominent during the recent financial crisis. Our
theoretical considerations on the time varying model which provides the
platform upon which we integrate our multifaceted empirical approaches are also
of independent interest. In particular, we provide the general solution for low
order time varying specifications, which is a long standing research topic.

performance can best be tackled through simulations of the expected
observations. The complex interplay of various noise sources in the course of
the observations make such simulations an indispensable part of the assessment
and design study of any space-based mission. We present a formalism to model
and simulate photometric time series of CCD images by including models of the
CCD and its electronics, the telescope optics, the stellar field, the jitter
movements of the spacecraft, and all important natural noise sources. This
formalism has been implemented in a versatile end-to-end simulation software
tool, called PLATO Simulator, specifically designed for the PLATO space mission
to be operated from L2, but easily adaptable to similar types of missions. We
provide a detailed description of several noise sources and discuss their
properties, in connection with the optical design, the allowable level of
jitter, the quantum efficiency of the detectors, etc. The expected overall
noise budget of generated light curves is computed as a function of the stellar

to many breakthroughs in the exoplanet search and in stellar physics. Stellar
magnetic activity results from the interaction between rotation, convection,
and magnetic field. Constraining these processes is important if we want to
better understand stellar magnetic activity. Using the Sun, we want to test a
magnetic activity index based on the analysis of the photo- metric response and
then apply it to a sample of M dwarfs observed by Kepler. We estimate a global
stellar magnetic activity index by measuring the standard deviation of the
whole time series, Sph. Because stellar variability can be related to
convection, pulsations, or magnetism, we need to ensure that this index mostly
takes into account magnetic effects. We define another stellar magnetic
activity index as the average of the standard deviation of shorter subseries
which lengths are determined by the rotation period of the star. This way we
can ensure that the measured photometric variability is related to starspots
crossing the visible stellar disk. This new index combined with a
time-frequency analysis based on the Morlet wavelets allows us to determine the
existence of magnetic activity cycles. We measure magnetic indexes for the Sun
and for 34 M dwarfs observed by Kepler. As expected, we obtain that the sample
of M dwarfs studied in this work is much more active than the Sun. Moreover, we
find a small correlation between the rotation period and the magnetic index.

discover the presence of long-lived features suggesting the existence of active

systems close to criticality are thought to maximise their dynamic range of

detecting LRTCs. We test this framework against two classical models of
criticality (Ising and Kuramoto) and recently described variants of these

simulations we determine the parameters at which these systems show evidence of
LRTCs in phase synchronisation. We demonstrate proof of principle by analysing
pairs of human simultaneous EEG and EMG time series, suggesting that LRTCs of
corticomuscular phase synchronisation can be detected in the resting state. The
existence of LRTCs in fluctuations of phase synchronisation suggests that these
fluctuations are governed by non-local behaviour. This has important
implications regarding the conditions under which one should expect to see
LRTCs in phase synchronisation. Specifically, brain resting states may exhibit

when they are applied to complicated time series. We conjecture that the
inherent complexity of real-world time-series data---which results from the
dimension, nonlinearity, and non-stationarity of the generating process, as
well as from measurement issues like noise, aggregation, and finite data
length---is both empirically quantifiable and directly correlated with
predictability. In particular, we argue that redundancy is an effective way to
measure complexity and predictive structure in an experimental time series and
that weighted permutation entropy is an effective way to estimate that
redundancy. To validate these conjectures, we study 120 different time-series
data sets. For each time series, we construct predictions using a wide variety
of forecast models, then compare the accuracy of the predictions with the
permutation entropy of that time series. We use the results to develop a
model-free heuristic that can help practitioners recognize when a particular

sequential data. The parameter estimation for HMMs from time series data is an
important learning problem. The predominant methods for parameter estimation
are based on local search heuristics, most notably the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithm. These methods are prone to local optima and oftentimes suffer
from high computational and sample complexity. Recent years saw the emergence
of spectral methods for the parameter estimation of HMMs, based on a method of
moments approach. Two spectral learning algorithms as proposed by Hsu, Kakade
and Zhang 2012 (arXiv:0811.4413) and Anandkumar, Hsu and Kakade 2012
(arXiv:1203.0683) are assessed in this work. Using experiments with synthetic
data, the algorithms are compared with each other. Furthermore, the spectral
methods are compared to the Baum-Welch algorithm, a well-established method
applying the EM algorithm to HMMs. The spectral algorithms are found to have a
much more favorable computational and sample complexity. Even though the
algorithms readily handle high dimensional observation spaces, instability

super-luminous supernovae followed by the Public ESO Spectroscopic Survey of
Transient Objects (PESSTO). Time series spectroscopy from a few days after
maximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class,
with spectra dominated by Ca II, Mg II, Fe II and Si II, which evolve slowly
over most of the post-peak photospheric phase. We determine bolometric light
curves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy input
by magnetar spin-down, 56Ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaque
circumstellar shell. We investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of our
sample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain the
possible mechanisms behind these events. We have followed these events to
beyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fading
supernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diverse
behaviour at this phase. Models powered by radioactivity require unrealistic
parameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previous
studies. Both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to be
viable candidates. A large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phase
luminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapid
drop in flux. This would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, or
that the X-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. The light
curve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d after

Time series spectroscopy from a few days after\nmaximum light to 100 days later shows them to be fairly typical of this class,\nwith spectra dominated by Ca II, Mg II, Fe II and Si II, which evolve slowly\nover most of the post-peak photospheric phase. We determine bolometric light\ncurves and apply simple fitting tools, based on the diffusion of energy input\nby magnetar spin-down, 56Ni decay, and collision of the ejecta with an opaque\ncircumstellar shell. We investigate how the heterogeneous light curves of our\nsample (combined with others from the literature) can help to constrain the\npossible mechanisms behind these events. We have followed these events to\nbeyond 100-200 days after peak, to disentangle host galaxy light from fading\nsupernova flux and to differentiate between the models, which predict diverse\nbehaviour at this phase. Models powered by radioactivity require unrealistic\nparameters to reproduce the observed light curves, as found by previous\nstudies. Both magnetar heating and circumstellar interaction still appear to be\nviable candidates. A large diversity is emerging in observed tail-phase\nluminosities, with magnetar models failing in some cases to predict the rapid\ndrop in flux. This would suggest either that magnetars are not responsible, or\nthat the X-ray flux from the magnetar wind is not fully trapped. The light\ncurve of one object shows a distinct re-brightening at around 100d after\nmaximum light.

avalanches exhibit scale invariant behavior similar to self-organized critical
systems, we study the role of noisy (non-conservative) local dynamics on the
critical behavior of a sandpile model which can be taken to mimic the dynamics
of neuronal avalanches. We find that despite the fact that noise breaks the
strict local conservation required to attain criticality, our system exhibit
true criticality for a wide range of noise in various dimensions, given that
conservation is respected \textit{on the average}. Although the system remains
critical, exhibiting finite-size scaling, the value of critical exponents
change depending on the intensity of local noise. Interestingly, for
sufficiently strong noise level, the critical exponents approach and saturate
at their mean-field values, consistent with empirical measurements of neuronal
avalanches. This is confirmed for both two and three dimensional models.
However, addition of noise does not affect the exponents at the upper critical
dimension ($D=4$). In addition to extensive finite-size scaling analysis of our
systems, we also employ a useful time-series analysis method in order to
establish true criticality of noisy systems. Finally, we discuss the
implications of our work in neuroscience as well as some implications for

Although the system remains\ncritical, exhibiting finite-size scaling, the value of critical exponents\nchange depending on the intensity of local noise. Interestingly, for\nsufficiently strong noise level, the critical exponents approach and saturate\nat their mean-field values, consistent with empirical measurements of neuronal\navalanches. This is confirmed for both two and three dimensional models.\nHowever, addition of noise does not affect the exponents at the upper critical\ndimension ($D=4$). In addition to extensive finite-size scaling analysis of our\nsystems, we also employ a useful time-series analysis method in order to\nestablish true criticality of noisy systems.

However, real world environmental processes are highly complex and are seldom

dynamic spatio-temporal models (NLDSTMs) based on the idea of nonlinear
observational and evolutionary equation have been proposed as an alternative.
However, in that case, the caveat lies in selecting the specific form of
