valuable tracers on the Milky Way mass and its formation. Beyond 100 kpc from
the Galactic center, most of the stars are likely to be in faint dwarf galaxies

Galaxy important for understanding the Milky Way's accretion history. However,
distant stars in the halo are scarce. In that context, RR Lyrae are ideal
probes of the distant halo as they are intrinsically bright and thus can be
seen at large distances, follow well-known period-luminosity relations that
enable precise distance measurements, and are easily identifiable in
time-series data. Therefore, a detailed study of RR Lyrae will help us
understand the accreted outskirts of the Milky Way. In this contribution, we
present the current state of our systematic search for distant RR Lyrae stars

a considerable number of candidate RR Lyrae beyond 100 kpc, and reaches out up

optimal determination of the characteristics of the extrema of 1000+ variable
stars of different types, mainly eclipsing and pulsating. The approximations
are phenomenological, but not physical. As often, the discovery of a new
variable star is made on time series of a single-filter (single-channel) data,
and there is no possibility to determine parameters needed for physical
modelling (e.g. temperature, radial velocities, mass ratio of binaries).
Besides classical polynomial approximation ""AP"" (we limited the degree of the
polynomial from 2 to 9), there are realized symmetrical approximations
(symmetrical polynomials ""SP"", ""wall-supported"" horizontal line ""WSL"" and
parabola ""WSP"", restricted polynomials of non-integer order based on
approximations of the functions proposed by Andronov (2012) and Mikulasek
(2015) and generally asymmetric functions (asymptotic parabola ""AP"", parabolic
spline ""PS"", generalized hyperbolic secant function ""SECH"" and
""log-normal-like"" ""BSK""). This software is a successor of the ""Observation
Obscurer"" with some features for the variable star research, including a block
for ""running parabola"" ""RP"" scalegram and approximation. Whereas the RP is
oriented on approximation of the complete data set. MAVKA is pointed to parts
of the light curve close to extrema (including total eclipses and transits of

two parameters are determined by a multi-objective optimization process.

low and the number of sunspots was extremely reduced. This epoch is known as
the Maunder Minimum (MM). The study of stars in prolonged activity minima like
the MM could help to shed light on this enigmatic epoch.
  Aims. To explore if the star $\zeta^{2}$ Ret, which belongs to a binary
system, is in a state similar to the MM. We have collected more than 430
spectra acquired between 2000 and 2019 with the HARPS, REOSC, UVES, and FEROS
spectrographs.
  Methods. We performed a detailed long-term activity study of both components
using the Mount Wilson index, which is obtained from the Ca II H\&K lines. To
search for signs of an activity cycle, we analyzed the resulting time-series
with the Generalized Lomb-Scargle and CLEAN periodograms.
  Results. Our spectroscopic analysis shows a high activity level for zet01 Ret
and a significant decrease in the magnetic activity cycle amplitude of
$\zeta^{2}$ Ret. Thus, the activity difference between both components has been
slightly increased ($\Delta$log (RHK) $\sim$0.24 dex), when compared to the
previously reported value. The long series analyzed here allowed us to
recalculate and constrain the period of $\zeta^{2}$ Ret to $\sim$7.9 yr. We
also detected a long-term activity cycle of $\sim$4.2 yr in $\zeta^{1}$ Ret.
  Conclusions. By analogy with the scenario that proposes a weak solar cycle
during the MM, we suggest that activity signatures showed by $\zeta^{2}$ Ret,
i.e., a very low activity level when compared to its stellar companion, a
notably decreasing amplitude ($\sim$47%), and a cyclic behaviour, are possible
evidence that this star could be in a MM state. It is, to our knowledge, the
first MM candidate star detected through a highly discrepant activity behaviour

canonical data segmentation problem which aims at detecting and localising
multiple change points in the mean of univariate time series. We provide an
overview of popular methodologies on their computational complexity and
theoretical properties. In particular, our theoretical discussion focuses on
the separation rate relating to which change points are detectable by a given
procedure, and the localisation rate quantifying the precision of corresponding
change point estimators, and we distinguish between whether a homogeneous or
multiscale viewpoint has been adopted in their derivation. We further highlight
that the latter viewpoint provides the most general setting for investigating
the optimality of data segmentation algorithms.

dependencies in data. These data sets, such as hourly medical records in
intensive care units and multi-frequency phonetic time series, often time
exhibit not only strong serial dependencies in the individual components (the
""marginal"" memory) but also non-negligible memories in the cross-sectional
dependencies (the ""joint"" memory). Because of the multivariate complexity in
the evolution of the joint distribution that underlies the data generating
process, we take a data-driven approach and construct a novel recurrent network
architecture, termed Memory-Gated Recurrent Networks (mGRN), with gates
explicitly regulating two distinct types of memories: the marginal memory and
the joint memory. Through a combination of comprehensive simulation studies and

biological quantities in humans that cannot be directly measured. We develop
the method by focusing on estimating hepatic enzyme and drug transporter
activity through breath-biopsy samples clinically obtained via the erythromycin
breath test (EBT): a small dose of radio-labeled drug is injected and the
subsequent content of radio-labeled CO$_2$ is measured repeatedly in exhaled
breath; the resulting time series is analyzed. To model EBT we developed a
14-variable non-linear reduced order dynamical model that describes the
behavior of the drug and its metabolites in the human body well enough to
capture all biological phenomena of interest. Based on this system of coupled
non-linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) we treat the measurement
problem as inverse problem: we estimate the ODE parameters of individual
patients from the measured EBT time series. These estimates then provide a
measurement of the liver activity of interest. The parameters are hard to
estimate as the ODEs are stiff and the problem needs to be regularized to
ensure stable convergence. We develop a formal operator framework to capture
and treat the specific non-linearities present, and perform perturbation
analysis to establish properties of the estimation procedure and its solution.
Development of the method required 150,000 CPU hours at a supercomputing
center, and a single production run takes CPU 24 hours. We introduce and
analyze the method in the context of future precision dosing of drugs for

dynamical system, that understanding a system as a group of nodes interacting

modelling complex systems. However, finding such models according to the time

videos using event-level timing information but it cannot realize fine-grained
forgery detection and localization on each frame. To fill this gap, this paper
proposes Secure-Pose, a novel cross-modal forgery detection and localization
system for live surveillance videos using WiFi signals near the camera spot. We
observe that coexisting camera and WiFi signals convey common human semantic
information and the presence of forgery attacks on video frames will decouple
such information correspondence. Secure-Pose extracts effective human pose
features from synchronized multi-modal signals and detects and localizes
forgery traces under both inter-frame and intra-frame attacks in each frame. We
implement Secure-Pose using a commercial camera and two Intel 5300 NICs and
evaluate it in real-world environments. Secure-Pose achieves a high detection
accuracy of 95.1% and can effectively localize tampered objects under different

estimating directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. It is a

classification using a support vector machine. As a reference method, we
compare our results with cross-correlation, which is typically used in the
literature as a standard measure of functional connectivity. Within a

0% and an imposed velocity up to 3 m/s, while the characteristic sizes of
heaters range from 1.3 $\mu$m up to few hundreds of microns. At low heat

dependence emerges at larger heat flux, as reported previously, and three

Second, the velocity dependence of the mean heat transfer is compatible with
the square-root dependence observed in classical fluids. Surprisingly, the

connectivity analysis in complex systems. The lsAGC algorithm combines
dimension reduction with source time-series augmentation and uses predictive
time-series modeling for estimating directed causal relationships among
time-series. This method is a multivariate approach, since it is capable of
identifying the influence of each time-series on any other time-series in the
presence of all other time-series of the underlying dynamic system. We
quantitatively evaluate the performance of lsAGC on synthetic directional
time-series networks with known ground truth. As a reference method, we compare
our results with cross-correlation, which is typically used as a standard
measure of connectivity in the functional MRI (fMRI) literature. Using
extensive simulations for a wide range of time-series lengths and two different
signal-to-noise ratios of 5 and 15 dB, lsAGC consistently outperforms
cross-correlation at accurately detecting network connections, using Receiver
Operator Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis, across all tested time-series
lengths and noise levels. In addition, as an outlook to possible clinical
application, we perform a preliminary qualitative analysis of connectivity
matrices for fMRI data of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients and typical
controls, using a subset of 59 subjects of the Autism Brain Imaging Data
Exchange II (ABIDE II) data repository. Our results suggest that lsAGC, by
extracting sparse connectivity matrices, may be useful for network analysis in

The lsAGC algorithm combines\ndimension reduction with source time-series augmentation and uses predictive\ntime-series modeling for estimating directed causal relationships among\ntime-series. This method is a multivariate approach, since it is capable of\nidentifying the influence of each time-series on any other time-series in the\npresence of all other time-series of the underlying dynamic system. We\nquantitatively evaluate the performance of lsAGC on synthetic directional\ntime-series networks with known ground truth. As a reference method, we compare\nour results with cross-correlation, which is typically used as a standard\nmeasure of connectivity in the functional MRI (fMRI) literature. Using\nextensive simulations for a wide range of time-series lengths and two different\nsignal-to-noise ratios of 5 and 15 dB, lsAGC consistently outperforms\ncross-correlation at accurately detecting network connections, using Receiver\nOperator Characteristic Curve (ROC) analysis, across all tested time-series\nlengths and noise levels. In addition, as an outlook to possible clinical\napplication, we perform a preliminary qualitative analysis of connectivity\nmatrices for fMRI data of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) patients and typical\ncontrols, using a subset of 59 subjects of the Autism Brain Imaging Data\nExchange II (ABIDE II) data repository.

particularly the case in ""new-physics"" searches. To this aim, we train our DNN
on synthetic oscillating time series to perform two tasks: a regression of the

architecture. We show that the regression and denoising performance is similar
to those of least-square curve fittings (LS-fit) with true latent parameters'
initial guesses, in spite of the DNN needing no initial guesses at all. We then
explore applications in which we believe our architecture could prove useful
for time-series processing in physics, when prior knowledge is incomplete. As
an example, we employ DNNs as a tool to inform LS-fits when initial guesses are
unknown. We show that the regression can be performed on some latent
parameters, while ignoring the existence of others. Because the Autoencoder
needs no prior information about the physical model, the remaining unknown
latent parameters can still be captured, thus making use of partial prior
knowledge, while leaving space for data exploration and discoveries.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=11000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in pattern-recognition tasks for\nwhich a human comprehensible, quantitative description of the data-generating\nprocess, e.g., in the form of equations, cannot be achieved.

We show that, because DNNs can find useful\nabstract feature representations, they can be used when prior knowledge about\nthe signal-generating process exists, but is not complete, as it is\nparticularly the case in ""new-physics"" searches. To this aim, we train our DNN\non synthetic oscillating time series to perform two tasks: a regression of the\nsignal latent parameters and signal denoising by an Autoencoder-like\narchitecture. We show that the regression and denoising performance is similar\nto those of least-square curve fittings (LS-fit) with true latent parameters\'\ninitial guesses, in spite of the DNN needing no initial guesses at all. We then\nexplore applications in which we believe our architecture could prove useful\nfor time-series processing in physics, when prior knowledge is incomplete. As\nan example, we employ DNNs as a tool to inform LS-fits when initial guesses are\nunknown. We show that the regression can be performed on some latent\nparameters, while ignoring the existence of others. Because the Autoencoder\nneeds no prior information about the physical model, the remaining unknown\nlatent parameters can still be captured, thus making use of partial prior\nknowledge, while leaving space for data exploration and discoveries.'}","[{'name': 'Antoine Garcon'}, {'name': 'Julian Vexler'}, {'name': 'Dmitry Budker'}, {'name': 'Stefan Kramer'}]",{'name': 'Stefan Kramer'},Stefan Kramer,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.03850v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.03850v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.NA', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'math.NA', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'physics.data-an', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,

evaluate the effect of the Coriolis acceleration on g-modes, to include the

We present an approach for forecasting mental health conditions and
emotions of a given population during the COVID-19 pandemic in Argentina based
on language expressions used in social media. This approach permits
anticipating high prevalence periods in short- to medium-term time horizons.
Design. Mental health conditions and emotions are captured via markers, which
link social media contents with lexicons. First, we build descriptive timelines
for decision makers to monitor the evolution of markers, and their correlation
with crisis events. Second, we model the timelines as time series, and support
their forecasting, which in turn serve to identify high prevalence points for
the estimated markers. Findings. Results showed that different time series
forecasting strategies offer different capabilities. In the best scenario, the
emergence of high prevalence periods of emotions and mental health disorders
can be satisfactorily predicted with a neural network strategy, even when
limited data is available in early stages of a crisis (e.g., 7 days).
Originality. Although there have been efforts in the literature to predict
mental states of individuals, the analysis of mental health at the collective
level has received scarce attention. We take a step forward by proposing a
forecasting approach for analyzing the mental health of a given population (or
group of individuals) at a larger scale. Practical implications. We believe

processes related to crisis manifest in social media, being a valuable asset

fine-grained, multiscale dynamical system, we propose a generative framework
for learning an effective, lower-dimensional, coarse-grained dynamical model
that is predictive of the fine-grained system's long-term evolution but also of
its behavior under different initial conditions. We target fine-grained models
as they arise in physical applications (e.g. molecular dynamics, agent-based
models), the dynamics of which are strongly non-stationary but their transition
to equilibrium is governed by unknown slow processes which are largely
inaccessible by brute-force simulations. Approaches based on domain knowledge
heavily rely on physical insight in identifying temporally slow features and
fail to enforce the long-term stability of the learned dynamics. On the other
hand, purely statistical frameworks lack interpretability and rely on large
amounts of expensive simulation data (long and multiple trajectories) as they
cannot infuse domain knowledge. The generative framework proposed achieves the
aforementioned desiderata by employing a flexible prior on the complex plane
for the latent, slow processes, and an intermediate layer of physics-motivated
latent variables that reduces reliance on data and imbues inductive bias. In
contrast to existing schemes, it does not require the a priori definition of
projection operators from the fine-grained description and addresses
simultaneously the tasks of dimensionality reduction and model estimation. We
demonstrate its efficacy and accuracy in multiscale physical systems of
particle dynamics where probabilistic, long-term predictions of phenomena not
contained in the training data are produced.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=11000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""Given (small amounts of) time-series' data from a high-dimensional,\nfine-grained, multiscale dynamical system, we propose a generative framework\nfor learning an effective, lower-dimensional, coarse-grained dynamical model\nthat is predictive of the fine-grained system's long-term evolution but also of\nits behavior under different initial conditions.

years ago. This paper presents a solution that, as far as we know, for the

unrelated parts of the system) has been explained by narratives such as
deregulation and leverage. But can we diagnose and quantify the ongoing

energy generation in power grids using Photovoltaic (PV) systems. This
investigation proposes an efficient method of data processing for the
statistical quantification of cloud features using long-wave Infrared (IR)
images and Global Solar Irradiance (GSI) measurements. The infrared images are
obtained using a Data Acquisition System (DAQ) mounted on a solar tracker. We
explain how to remove cyclostationary biases in global solar irradiance
measurements. Seasonal trends are removed from the global solar irradiance time
series, using the theoretical global solar irradiance to obtain the Clear Sky

of atmospheric scattering and the effect of the Sun's direct irradiance from
infrared images. Scattering is produced by water spots and dust particles on
the germanium lens of the enclosure. We explain how to remove the scattering
effect produced by the germanium lens attached to the data acquisition system

This method\nprovides a theoretical guarantee that it asymptotically performs as well as any\nQAR at any time point in the future. We show that these methods can predict the\nsize and inter-arrival time of cyber hacking breaches by running coverage\ntests. The proposed approaches allow to model a separate stochastic process for\neach significance level and therefore provide more flexibility compared to\npreviously proposed techniques.

convective dynamics in the solar photosphere, though few direct observations of

reliably discriminate the local wave signal from the background convective

contributions have amplitudes several orders of magnitude greater than the
sources and the propagating wave fields they induce. In this paper, we employ a
high-temporal-frequency filter to identify sites of acoustic emission in a

are found to be clustered at mesogranular scales, with peak emission quite

delays. Among these are reverberation mapping, and lensed quasars. In some
systems, the measurement of the time-delay is complicated by the fact that the
delayed components are unresolved and that the light curves are generated from
a red-noise process. We derive the likelihood function of the observations
given a model of either a combination of time-delayed light curves or a single
light curve. This likelihood function is different from the auto-correlation
function. We demonstrate that given a single-band light curve that is a
combination of two (or more) time-shifted copies of an original light curve,
generated from a red-noise probability distribution, we can test if the
total-flux light curve is a composition of time-delayed copies or,
alternatively, is consistent with being the original light curve. Furthermorew,
in some realistic cases, it is possible to measure the time delays and flux
ratios between these unresolved components even when the flux ratio is about
1/10. This method is useful for identifying lensed quasars and simultaneously
measuring their time delays, and for estimating the reverberation time scales
of active galactic nuclei. In a companion paper, we derive a method that uses
the center-of-light position (e.g., of a lensed quasar) along with the combined
flux. This allow us to identify lensed quasars and supernovae and measure their
time delays, with higher fidelity compared to the flux-only method. The
astrometry + flux method, however, is not suitable for quasar reverberation
mapping. We also comment on the commonly used method of fitting a power-law
model to a power spectrum, and present the proper likelihood function for such
a fit. We test the new method on simulations and provide Python and MATLAB

recognition and imitation learning. In recent years, deep neural networks
(DNNs) have emerged as an effective data-driven methodology for processing
sequences given sufficient training data and compute resources. However, when
data is limited, simpler models such as logic/rule-based methods work
surprisingly well, especially when relevant prior knowledge is applied in their
construction. However, unlike DNNs, these ""structured"" models can be difficult
to extend, and do not work well with raw unstructured data. In this work, we
seek to learn flexible DNNs, yet leverage prior temporal knowledge when
available. Our approach is to embed symbolic knowledge expressed as linear
temporal logic (LTL) and use these embeddings to guide the training of deep
models. Specifically, we construct semantic-based embeddings of automata

The large and

computationally efficient methods for detecting and characterizing such

that exploit the $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ scaling of the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT). However, these methods are not optimal for non-sinusoidal signal shapes.
Template fits (or periodic matched filters) optimize sensitivity for a priori
known signal shapes but at a significant computational cost. Current

exploit graph neural networks (GNN) to better learn spatial and temporal
dependencies between sensors, they cannot model time-evolving spatio-temporal
correlation (STC) between sensors, and require pre-defined graphs, which are
neither always available nor totally reliable, and target at only a specific
type of sensor data at one time. Moreover, since the form of time-series
fluctuation is varied across sensors, a model needs to learn fluctuation
modulation. To tackle these issues, in this work, we propose a novel GNN-based

multi-graph convolution with sequential learning is developed to learn

Previous studies that have focused on the largest flares have shown that even
these extreme cases generate enhancements in Lya of only a few percent above
the background. In this study, a superposed-epoch analysis was performed on
~8500 flares greater than B1 class to determine the contribution that flares
make to changes in the solar EUV irradiance. Using the peak of the 1-8A X-ray
emission as a fiducial time, the corresponding time series of 3123 B- and 4972

averaged to reduce background fluctuations and improve the flare signal. The
summation of these weaker events showed that they produced a 0.1-0.3%

technique was applied to 453 M- and 31 X-class flares, which resulted in a 1-4%
increase in Lya emission. Flares were also averaged with respect to their
heliographic angle to investigate any potential center-to-limb variation. For
each GOES class, the relative enhancement in Lya at the flare peak was found to
diminish for flares that occurred closer to the solar limb due to the opacity
of the line, and/or foreshortening of the footpoints. One modest event included

datasets has recently become almost ubiquitous, given their ease of use and
flexibility. GPs excel in particular at marginalization over the stellar signal
in cases where the variability due to starspots rotating in and out of view is
treated as a nuisance, such as in exoplanet transit modeling. However, these
effective models are less useful in cases where the starspot signal is of
primary interest since it is not obvious how the parameters of the GP model are

Lomb-Scargle periodograms, and searched for QPOs using wavelet scalograms. We
also attempted to classify the GRBs using the Hurst exponent, $H$, and the
$\mathcal{A}-\mathcal{T}$ plane. The PSDs fall into three categories: power law
(PL; $P(f)\propto 1/f^\beta$) with index $\beta\in(0,2)$, PL with a
non-negligible Poisson noise level (PLC) with $\beta\in(1,3)$, and a smoothly
broken PL (SBPL; with Poisson noise level) yielding high-frequency index
$\beta_2\in(2,6)$. The latter yields break time scales on the order of
1--100\,seconds. The PL and PLC models are broadly consistent with a fully
developed turbulence, $\beta=5/3$. For an overwhelming majority of GRBs (93\%),
$H>0.5$, implying ubiquity of the long-term memory. We find no convincing
substructure in the $\mathcal{A}-\mathcal{T}$ plane. Finally, we report on 34
new QPOs: with one or more constant leading periods, as well as several
chirping signals. The presence of breaks and QPOs suggests the existence of
characteristic time scales that in at least some GRBs might be related to the

path to study the processes that shape planet evolution. We report on the
discovery of a sub-Neptune-size planet orbiting the young star HD 110082
(TOI-1098). Transit events we initially detected during TESS Cycle 1 are
validated with time-series photometry from Spitzer. High-contrast imaging and
high-resolution, optical spectra are also obtained to characterize the stellar
host and confirm the planetary nature of the transits. The host star is a late
F dwarf (M=1.2 Msun) with a low-mass, M dwarf binary companion (M=0.26 Msun)
separated by nearly one arcminute (~6200 AU). Based on its rapid rotation and
Lithium absorption, HD 110082 is young, but is not a member of any known group
of young stars (despite proximity to the Octans association). To measure the
age of the system, we search for coeval, phase-space neighbors and compile a
sample of candidate siblings to compare with the empirical sequences of young
clusters and to apply quantitative age-dating techniques. In doing so, we find
that HD 110082 resides in a new young stellar association we designate
MELANGE-1, with an age of 250(+50/-70) Myr. Jointly modeling the TESS and
Spitzer light curves, we measure a planetary orbital period of 10.1827 days and
radius of Rp = 3.2(+/-0.1) Earth radii. HD 110082 b's radius falls in the

considering a restricted model of only technical indicators and an unrestricted
model with technical, trading and social media indicators. We verified whether
the consideration of trading and social media indicators, along with the
classic technical variables (such as price's returns), leads to a significative
improvement in the prediction of cryptocurrencies price's changes. We conducted
the study on the two highest cryptocurrencies in volume and value (at the time

learning algorithms typically used in time-series classification problems:
Multi Layers Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short

We devised the experiments using the advanced bootstrap technique to consider
the variance problem on test samples, which allowed us to evaluate a more
reliable estimate of the model's performance. Furthermore, the Grid Search
technique was used to find the best hyperparameters values for each implemented
algorithm. The study shows that, based on the hourly frequency results, the
unrestricted model outperforms the restricted one. The addition of the trading

Graph structures among time series are found in diverse domains, such as web
traffic influenced by hyperlinks, product sales influenced by recommendation,
or urban transport volume influenced by road networks and weather. There has
been recent progress in graph modeling and in time series forecasting,
respectively, but an expressive and scalable approach for a network of series
does not yet exist. We introduce Radflow, a novel model that embodies three key
ideas: a recurrent neural network to obtain node embeddings that depend on
time, the aggregation of the flow of influence from neighboring nodes with
multi-head attention, and the multi-layer decomposition of time series. Radflow
naturally takes into account dynamic networks where nodes and edges change over
time, and it can be used for prediction and data imputation tasks. On
real-world datasets ranging from a few hundred to a few hundred thousand nodes,
we observe that Radflow variants are the best performing model across a wide
range of settings. The recurrent component in Radflow also outperforms N-BEATS,
the state-of-the-art time series model. We show that Radflow can learn
different trends and seasonal patterns, that it is robust to missing nodes and
edges, and that correlated temporal patterns among network neighbors reflect
influence strength. We curate WikiTraffic, the largest dynamic network of time
series with 366K nodes and 22M time-dependent links spanning five years. This
dataset provides an open benchmark for developing models in this area, with
applications that include optimizing resources for the web. More broadly,

interplanetary space. Despite being major space weather drivers, our knowledge
of the CME properties in the inner heliosphere remains constrained by the
scarcity of observations at distances other than 1 au. Furthermore, most CMEs
are observed in situ by single spacecraft, requiring numerical models to
complement the sparse observations available. We aim to assess the ability of
the linear force-free spheromak CME model in EUHFORIA to describe the radial
evolution of interplanetary CMEs, yielding new context for observational
studies. We model one well-studied CME, and investigate its radial evolution by
placing virtual spacecraft along the Sun-Earth line in the simulation domain.
To directly compare observational and modelling results, we characterise the
interplanetary CME signatures between 0.2 and 1.9 au from modelled time series,
exploiting techniques traditionally employed to analyse real in situ data.
Results show that the modelled radial evolution of the mean solar wind and CME
values is consistent with observational and theoretical expectations. The CME
expands as a consequence of the decaying pressure in the surrounding wind: the
expansion is rapid within 0.4 au, and moderate at larger distances. The early
rapid expansion could not explain the overestimated CME radial size in our
simulation, suggesting this is an intrinsic limitation of the spheromak
geometry used. The magnetic field profile indicates a relaxation of the CME
during propagation, while ageing is most probably not a substantial source of
magnetic asymmetry beyond 0.4 au. We also report a CME wake that is
significantly shorter than suggested by observations. Overall, EUHFORIA
provides a consistent description of the radial evolution of solar wind and

$a=0.02\,\mathrm{au}$, corresponding to an orbital period $P_\mathrm{b}\simeq
4\,\mathrm{d}$, inducing long-term variations of the planetary obliquity
$\varepsilon$ which, under certain circumstances, may not be deemed as
negligible from the point of view of life's sustainability. I resume the
analytical orbit-averaged equations of the pK precessions, both classical and
general relativistic, of the unit vectors
$\boldsymbol{\hat{S}},\,\boldsymbol{\hat{h}}$ of both the planet's spin and
orbital angular momenta $\boldsymbol S,\,\boldsymbol{L}$ entering
$\varepsilon$, and numerically integrate them by producing time series of the
pK changes $\Delta\varepsilon(t)$ of the obliquity. For rapidly rotating M
dwarfs with rotational periods of the order of $P_\star \simeq
0.1-1\,\mathrm{d}$, the planet's obliquity $\varepsilon$ can undergo classical
pK large variations $\Delta\varepsilon(t)$ up to tens of degrees over
timescales $\Delta t \simeq 20-200\,\mathrm{kyr}$, depending on the mutual
orientations of the star's spin ${\boldsymbol J}_\star$, of $\boldsymbol S$,
and of $\boldsymbol L$. Instead, $\Delta\varepsilon(t)$ are $\lesssim
1-1.5^\circ$ for the planet b of the Teegarden's Star. In certain
circumstances, the M dwarf's oblateness $J_2^\star$ should be considered as one
of the key dynamical features to be taken into account in compiling budgets of
the long-term habitability of rocky planets around fast spinning late M dwarfs.

emission likely originate close to the WD because they disappear during the
eclipse that is centered on inferior conjunction of the secondary star. The
fraction of the Balmer emission remaining visible during eclipse has a steep
decrement and it is likely produced in the extended outflow. Most enticingly of

develop a crop classification method that exploits this expert knowledge and

hierarchy is encoded in a convolutional, recurrent neural network (convRNN),
such that for each pixel the model predicts three labels at different level of
granularity. This end-to-end trainable, hierarchical network architecture
allows the model to learn joint feature representations of rare classes (e.g.,

at different granularity also makes it possible to adjust the output according

been based on traditional machine learning approaches or time series modelling.
We propose here an alternate approach based on deep learning algorithms for
forecasting strawberry yields and prices in Santa Barbara county, California.
Building the proposed forecasting model comprises three stages: first, the
station-based ensemble model (ATT-CNN-LSTM-SeriesNet_Ens) with its compound
deep learning components, SeriesNet with Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and
Convolutional Neural Network LSTM with Attention layer (Att-CNN-LSTM), are
trained and tested using the station-based soil temperature and moisture data
of SantaBarbara as input and the corresponding strawberry yields or prices as
output. Secondly, the remote sensing ensemble model (SIM_CNN-LSTM_Ens), which
is an ensemble model of Convolutional NeuralNetwork LSTM (CNN-LSTM) models, is
trained and tested using satellite images of the same county as input mapped to
the same yields and prices as output. These two ensembles forecast strawberry
yields and prices with minimal forecasting errors and highest model correlation
for five weeks ahead forecasts.Finally, the forecasts of these two models are
ensembled to have a final forecasted value for yields and prices by introducing
a voting ensemble. Based on an aggregated performance measure (AGM), it is
found that this voting ensemble not only enhances the forecasting performance

assessing the effectiveness of heat alerts in reducing mortality and
hospitalization risks. We are interested in addressing the following question:
how many deaths and hospitalizations could be averted if we were to increase
the frequency of issuing heat alerts in a given location? In the context of
time series data, the overlap assumption - each unit must have a positive
probability of receiving the treatment - is often violated. This is because, in
a given location, issuing a heat alert is a rare event on an average
temperature day as heat alerts are almost always issued on extremely hot days.
To overcome this challenge, first we introduce a new class of causal estimands
under a stochastic intervention (i.e., increasing the odds of issuing a heat
alert) for a single time series corresponding to a given location. We develop
the theory to show that these causal estimands can be identified and estimated
under a weaker version of the overlap assumption. Second, we propose
nonparametric estimators based on time-varying propensity scores, and derive
point-wise confidence bands for these estimators. Third, we extend this
framework to multiple time series corresponding to multiple locations. Via
simulations, we show that the proposed estimator has good performance with

greatly with time due to environmental noise. In this work, we explore how to

substantially reduced flow artifacts.
  Methods: A projection-reconstruction (PR) trajectory is proposed for a
frequency-modulated cine sequence, facilitating reconstruction of three phase
cycles and a field-map time series from a short, breath-held scan. Data is also
acquired during the gradient rewinders to enable generation of field maps using
BMART, B$_0$ mapping using rewinding trajectories, where the rewind data forms
the second TE image for calculating the field map. A field-map-based
combination method is developed which weights the phase-cycle component images
to include only passband signal in the final cine images, and exclude stopband
and near-band flow artifacts.
  Results: The weights derived from the BMART-generated field maps mask out
banding and near-band flow artifacts in and around the heart. Therefore, the
field-map-based phase-cycle combination, which is facilitated by the PR
acquisition with BMART, results in more homogeneous blood pools and reduced
hyperintense regions than root-sum-of-squares.
  Conclusion: With the proposed techniques, using a non-Cartesian trajectory
for a frequency-modulated cine sequence enables flow-artifact-reduced
banding-free cardiac imaging within a short breath-hold.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=11000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Purpose: To develop a method for banding-free bSSFP cardiac cine with\nsubstantially reduced flow artifacts.\n  Methods: A projection-reconstruction (PR) trajectory is proposed for a\nfrequency-modulated cine sequence, facilitating reconstruction of three phase\ncycles and a field-map time series from a short, breath-held scan.

processes where the covariance matrix or spectral matrix smoothly evolve over
time. Most of the current approaches estimate the time-varying spectral
properties only retrospectively - that is, after the entire data has been
observed. Retrospective estimation is a major limitation in many adaptive
control applications where it is important to estimate these properties and
detect changes in the system as they happen in real-time. One major obstacle in
online estimation is the computational cost due to the high-dimensionality of
the parameters. Existing methods such as the Kalman filter or local least
squares are feasible. However, they are not always suitable because they
provide noisy estimates and can become prohibitively costly as the dimension of
the time series increases. In our brain signal application, it is critical to
develop a robust method that can estimate, in real-time, the properties of the
underlying stochastic process, in particular, the spectral brain connectivity
measures. For these reasons we propose a new smooth online parameter estimation
approach (SOPE) that has the ability to control for the smoothness of the

are fit in real-time even for high dimensional time series. We demonstrate that
our proposed SOPE approach is as good as the Kalman filter in terms of

SOPE has lower computational cost and hence scalable for higher dimensions.
Finally, we apply the SOPE method to a rat's local field potential data during

a year of human and computational effort. Deep learning (DL) based data-driven
seismic workflows (DSPW) hold the potential to reduce these timelines to a few
minutes. Raw seismic data (terabytes) and required subsurface prediction
(gigabytes) are enormous. This large-scale, spatially irregular time-series
data poses seismic data ingestion (SDI) as an unconventional yet fundamental
problem in DSPW. Current DL research is limited to small-scale simplified
synthetic datasets as they treat seismic data like images and process them with
convolution networks. Real seismic data, however, is at least 5D. Applying 5D
convolutions to this scale is computationally prohibitive. Moreover, raw
seismic data is highly unstructured and hence inherently non-image like. We
propose a fundamental shift to move away from convolutions and introduce SESDI:

two-step approach based on semantic image segmentation in order to predict

Based on bimodal interaction, more important bimodal features are\nassigned larger weights. In this way, different feature representations are\nadaptively assigned corresponding attention for effective multimodal fusion.\nExtensive experiments were conducted on both Chinese and English public\ndatasets. The results show that our approach outperforms the existing methods\nand can give an insight into the contributions of bimodal interaction among\nthree modalities.'}","[{'name': 'Ting Wu'}, {'name': 'Junjie Peng'}, {'name': 'Wenqiang Zhang'}, {'name': 'Huiran Zhang'}, {'name': 'Chuanshuai Ma'}, {'name': 'Yansong Huang'}]",{'name': 'Yansong Huang'},Yansong Huang,"25 pages, 4 figures, author name and format corrected","[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02362v2', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02362v2', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.AI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.AI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,

graph with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to construct a structural RNN

current financial regulatory market risk measure. Its estimation and
optimization are highly unstable against sample fluctuations and become
impossible above a critical ratio $r=N/T$, where $N$ is the number of different
assets in the portfolio, and $T$ is the length of the available time series.
The critical ratio depends on the confidence level $\alpha$, which means we
have a line of critical points on the $\alpha-r$ plane. The large fluctuations
in the estimation of ES can be attenuated by the application of regularizers.
In this paper, we calculate ES analytically under an $\ell_1$ regularizer by
the method of replicas borrowed from the statistical physics of random systems.
The ban on short selling, i.e. a constraint rendering all the portfolio weights
non-negative, is a special case of an asymmetric $\ell_1$ regularizer. Results
are presented for the out-of-sample and the in-sample estimator of the
regularized ES, the estimation error, the distribution of the optimal portfolio
weights and the density of the assets eliminated from the portfolio by the
regularizer. It is shown that the no-short constraint acts as a high volatility
cutoff, in the sense that it sets the weights of the high volatility elements
to zero with higher probability than those of the low volatility items. This
cutoff renormalizes the aspect ratio $r=N/T$, thereby extending the range of

(RVb-type) variable U Mon, a post-AGB binary with a circumbinary disk (CBD).
Our SMA observations indicate a CBD diameter of $\lesssim$550 au. Our
XMM-Newton observations make U Mon the first RV Tauri variable detected in
X-rays. The X-ray emission is characteristic of a hot plasma ($\sim$10 MK),
with L$_{X}=5\times10^{30}{\rm erg}~{\rm s}^{-1}$, and we consider its possible
origin from U Mon, its companion, and/or binary system interactions. Combining
DASCH and AAVSO data, we extend the time-series photometric baseline back to
the late 1880s and find evidence that U Mon has secular changes that appear to
recur on a timescale of $\sim$60 yr, possibly caused by a feature in the CBD.
From literature radial velocities we find that the binary companion is a
$\sim$2 M$_{\odot}$ A-type main-sequence star. The orientation of the binary's
orbit lies along our line of sight ($\omega = 95^\circ$), such that apastron
corresponds to photometric RVb minima, consistent with the post-AGB star
becoming obscured by the near side of the CBD. In addition, we find the size of
the inner-CBD hole ($\sim$4.5-9 au) to be comparable to the binary separation,
implying that one or both stars may interact with the CBD at apastron. The
obscuration of the post-AGB star implicates the companion as the likely source
of the enhanced H$\alpha$ observed at RVb minima and of the X-ray emission that
may arise from accreted material.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=11000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""We present X-ray through submillimeter observations of the classical RV Tauri\n(RVb-type) variable U Mon, a post-AGB binary with a circumbinary disk (CBD).\nOur SMA observations indicate a CBD diameter of $\\lesssim$550 au.

The resulting\ntransformed data can be processed with various existing regressors.\nExperimental validation on various benchmark data sets demonstrates the\nbenefits of the suggested approach.'}","[{'name': 'Dominique Gay'}, {'name': 'Alexis Bondu'}, {'name': 'Vincent Lemaire'}, {'name': 'Marc Boullé'}]",{'name': 'Marc Boullé'},Marc Boullé,,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-75762-5_63', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10247v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.10247v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,10.1007/978-3-030-75762-5_63,

Many pre-existing computational models that represent the process tend to focus

Bayesian probabilistic generative model called the prosodic hierarchical
Dirichlet process-hidden language model (Prosodic HDP-HLM). Prosodic HDP-HLM,
an extension of HDP-HLM, considers both prosodic and distributional cues within
a single integrative generative model. We conducted three experiments on
different types of datasets, and demonstrate the validity of the proposed
method. The results show that the Prosodic DAA successfully uses prosodic cues
and outperforms a method that solely uses distributional cues. The main
contributions of this study are as follows: 1) We develop a probabilistic
generative model for time series data including prosody that potentially has a
double articulation structure; 2) We propose the Prosodic DAA by deriving the
inference procedure for Prosodic HDP-HLM and show that Prosodic DAA can
discover words directly from continuous human speech signals using statistical

prosodic cues contribute to word segmentation more in naturally distributed

building changes in time series of remotely sensed imagery when footprint
labels are only available for a single point in time. The intuition behind the
model is that the relationship between spectral values inside and outside of
building's footprint will change when a building is constructed (or
demolished). For instance, in rural settings, the pre-construction area may
look similar to the surrounding environment until the building is constructed.
Similarly, in urban settings, the pre-construction areas will look different
from the surrounding environment until construction. We further propose a
heuristic method for selecting the parameters of our model which allows it to
be applied in novel settings without requiring data labeling efforts (to fit
the parameters). We apply our model over a dataset of poultry barns from
2016/2017 high-resolution aerial imagery in the Delmarva Peninsula and a
dataset of solar farms from a 2020 mosaic of Sentinel 2 imagery in India. Our
results show that our model performs as well when fit using the proposed
heuristic as it does when fit with labeled data, and further, that supervised
versions of our model perform the best among all the baselines we test against.
Finally, we show that our proposed approach can act as an effective data
augmentation strategy -- it enables researchers to augment existing structure
footprint labels along the time dimension and thus use imagery from multiple
points in time to train deep learning models. We show that this improves the
spatial generalization of such models when evaluated on the same change

rotating A2-type star KELT-20. Many atomic species have already been found in
its atmosphere, with blueshifted signals that hints at the presence of a
day-to-night side wind. We aimed to observe the atmospheric Rossiter-McLaughlin
effect in the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-20b, and to study any variation of the
atmospheric signal during the transit. For this purpose, we analysed five
nights of HARPS-N spectra covering five transits of KELT-20b. We computed the
mean line profiles of the spectra with a least-squares deconvolution, and then
we extracted the stellar radial velocities by fitting them with a rotational
broadening profile in order to obtain the radial velocity time-series. We used
the mean line profile residuals tomography to analyse the planetary atmospheric
signal and its variations. We also used the cross-correlation method to study
an already known double-peak feature in the FeI planetary signal. We observed
both the classical and the atmospheric Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in the radial
velocity time-series. The latter gave us an estimate of the radius of the
planetary atmosphere that correlates with the stellar mask used in our work:
R(p+atmo)/Rp = 1.13 +/- 0.02). We isolated the planetary atmospheric trace in
the tomography, and we found radial velocity variations of the planetary
atmospheric signal during transit with an overall blueshift of approximatively
10 km/s, along with small variations in the signal's depth and, less

of Covid-19 on the temporal distribution of Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
demand in Travis County, Austin, Texas and propose a robust model to forecast
Covid-19 EMS incidents. Methods: We analyzed the temporal distribution of EMS
calls in the Austin-Travis County area between January 1st, 2019 and December
31st, 2020. Change point detection was performed to identify critical dates
marking changes in EMS call distributions and time series regression was
applied for forecasting Covid-19 EMS incidents. Results: Two critical dates
marked the impact of Covid-19 on the distribution of EMS calls: March 17th,
when the daily number of non-pandemic EMS incidents dropped significantly, and
May 13th, by which the daily number of EMS calls climbed back to 75% of the
number in pre-Covid-19 time. New daily count of the hospitalization of Covid-19
patients alone proves a powerful predictor of the number of pandemic EMS calls,
with an r2 value equal to 0.85. In particular, for every 2.5 cases where EMS
takes a Covid-19 patient to a hospital, 1 person is admitted. Conclusion: The
mean daily number of non-pandemic EMS demand was significantly less than the
period prior to Covid-19 pandemic. The number of EMS calls for Covid-19

the studies tailored for social link inference in an LSN leverage user

close-in rocky planets form with a primordial gaseous envelope that is
subsequently stripped away by some thermally-driven mass loss process. These
two physical scenarios make unique predictions of the rocky/enveloped
transition's dependence on orbital separation such that studying the
compositions of planets within the M dwarf radius valley may be able to
establish the dominant physics. Here, we present the discovery of one such

challenging work for the researchers across the globe due to their seemingly

Lyapunov exponents fail to distinguish chaos when signal is mixed with noise.
This paper addresses the issue of segregating the dynamics in a rotor-stator
rub system when the vibrations are subjected to different levels of noise.
First, the limitation of 0-1 test in segregating chaos from signal mixed with
noise has been established. Second, the underexplored Benfords Law and its
application to the vibratory dynamical rotor-stator rub system has been
introduced for the first time. Using the Benfords Law Compliance Test (BLCT),
successful segregation of not only noise from chaos but also very low Signal to
Noise Ratio (SNR) signals which are mainly stochastic has been achieved. The
Euclidean Distance concept has been used to explore the scale-invariant
probability distribution of systems that comply with Benfords Law to separate
chaos from noise. Moreover, for moderate bands of noise in signals, we have
shown that the Schreibers Nonlinear Noise Reduction technique works effectively
in reducing the noise without damaging the dynamic properties of the system.
Combining these individual layers (0-1 Test, BLCT and Noise reduction) on a
rotor system, a Decision Tree based method to effectively segregate noise from
chaos and identify the correct dynamics of any system with time series data set
has been proposed.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=11000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Segregating noise from chaos in dynamic systems has been one of the\nchallenging work for the researchers across the globe due to their seemingly\nsimilar statistical properties.

stellar magnetic activity. Although this emission, quantified via the S-index,
has been serving as a prime proxy of stellar magnetic activity for several
decades, many aspects of the complex relation between stellar magnetism and Ca
II H & K emission are still unclear. The amount of measured Ca II H & K
emission is suspected to be affected not only by the stellar intrinsic
properties but also by the inclination angle of the stellar rotation axis.
Until now such an inclination effect on S-index has remained largely
unexplored. To fill this gap, we develop a physics-based model to calculate
S-index, focusing on the Sun. Using the distributions of solar magnetic
features derived from observations together with Ca II H & K spectra
synthesized in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium, we validate our model by
successfully reconstructing the observed variations of solar S-index over four
activity cycles. Further, using the distribution of magnetic features over the
visible solar disk obtained from surface flux transport simulations, we obtain
S-index time series dating back to 1700 and investigate the effect of
inclination on S-index variability, both on the magnetic activity cycle and the
rotational timescales. We find that when going from an equatorial to a pole-on
view, the amplitude of S-index variations decreases weakly on the activity
cycle timescale and strongly on the rotational timescale (by about 22% and 81%,
respectively, for a cycle of intermediate strength). The absolute value of
S-index depends only weakly on the inclination. We provide analytical
expressions that model such dependencies.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=11000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The emission in the near ultraviolet Ca II H & K lines is modulated by\nstellar magnetic activity.

high-dimensional, large-scale heterogeneous time series data using distributed
computing. The new method employs a multiple-fold dimension reduction procedure
using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and shows great promises for modeling
large-scale data that cannot be stored nor analyzed by a single machine. Each
computer at the basic level performs a PCA to extract common factors among the
time series assigned to it and transfers those factors to one and only one node
of the second level. Each 2nd-level computer collects the common factors from
its subordinates and performs another PCA to select the 2nd-level common
factors. This process is repeated until the central server is reached, which
collects common factors from its direct subordinates and performs a final PCA
to select the global common factors. The noise terms of the 2nd-level
approximate factor model are the unique common factors of the 1st-level
clusters. We focus on the case of 2 levels in our theoretical derivations, but
the idea can easily be generalized to any finite number of hierarchies. We
discuss some clustering methods when the group memberships are unknown and
introduce a new diffusion index approach to forecasting. We further extend the
analysis to unit-root nonstationary time series. Asymptotic properties of the
proposed method are derived for the diverging dimension of the data in each

performance standards. Therefore, we need to understand the trade-offs between
sample complexity and estimation accuracy of the system parameters. Simply
speaking, we need to address the question of how many measurements we need to
collect to identify the system parameters up to an uncertainty level. In this
paper, we address this problem under the assumption that long-term memory
dependencies at the state variables level do not change over time. The main

Neptunes. The paucity of cases for intermediate, Saturn-sized exoplanets at

are to assess the high-energy environment of the warm ($T_\mathrm{eq} = 970$ K)

far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations from the Hubble Space Telescope to analyze
the flux time series of H I, C II, Si III, Si IV, and N V during the transit of
WASP-29 b. At 3$\sigma$ confidence, we rule out any in-transit absorption of H
Ilarger than 92% in the Lyman-$\alpha$ blue wing and 19% in the red wing. We
found an in-transit flux decrease of $39\%^{+12\%}_{-11\%}$ in the ground-state
C II emission line at 133.45 nm. But due to this signal being significantly
present in only one visit, it is difficult to attribute a planetary or stellar
origin for the ground-state C II signal. We place 3$\sigma$ absorption upper
limits of 40%, 49% and 24% for Si III, Si IV, and for excited-state C II at
133.57 nm, respectively. Low activity levels and the faint X-ray luminosity
suggest that WASP-29 is an old, inactive star. An energy-limited approximation
combined with the reconstructed EUV spectrum of the host suggests that the
planet is losing its atmosphere at a rate of $4 \times 10^9$ g s$^{-1}$. The
non-detection at Lyman-$\alpha$ could be partly explained by a low fraction of
escaping neutral hydrogen, or by the state of fast radiative blow-out we infer
from the reconstructed stellar Lyman-$\alpha$ line.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=11000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': '(Abridged) Short-period gas giant exoplanets are susceptible to intense\natmospheric escape due to their large scale heights and strong high-energy\nirradiation.

We used\nfar-ultraviolet (FUV) observations from the Hubble Space Telescope to analyze\nthe flux time series of H I, C II, Si III, Si IV, and N V during the transit of\nWASP-29 b. At 3$\\sigma$ confidence, we rule out any in-transit absorption of H\nIlarger than 92% in the Lyman-$\\alpha$ blue wing and 19% in the red wing. We\nfound an in-transit flux decrease of $39\\%^{+12\\%}_{-11\\%}$ in the ground-state\nC II emission line at 133.45 nm. But due to this signal being significantly\npresent in only one visit, it is difficult to attribute a planetary or stellar\norigin for the ground-state C II signal. We place 3$\\sigma$ absorption upper\nlimits of 40%, 49% and 24% for Si III, Si IV, and for excited-state C II at\n133.57 nm, respectively. Low activity levels and the faint X-ray luminosity\nsuggest that WASP-29 is an old, inactive star. An energy-limited approximation\ncombined with the reconstructed EUV spectrum of the host suggests that the\nplanet is losing its atmosphere at a rate of $4 \\times 10^9$ g s$^{-1}$. The\nnon-detection at Lyman-$\\alpha$ could be partly explained by a low fraction of\nescaping neutral hydrogen, or by the state of fast radiative blow-out we infer\nfrom the reconstructed stellar Lyman-$\\alpha$ line.'}","[{'name': 'L.

from their disks. These systems are dynamic on timescales of hours to years.
The observed variability can help us infer the physical processes that occur in
the circumstellar environment. We aim at understanding the dynamics of the
magnetic interaction between the star and the inner accretion disk in young
stellar objects. We present the case of the young stellar system V2129 Oph,
which is a well-known T Tauri star. We performed a time series analysis of this
star using high-resolution spectroscopic data at optical and infrared
wavelengths from CFHT/ESPaDOnS, ESO/HARPS and CFHT/SPIRou. The new data sets
allowed us to characterize the accretion-ejection structure in this system and
to investigate its evolution over a timescale of a decade via comparisons to
previous observational data. We measure radial velocity variations and recover
a stellar rotation period of 6.53d. However, we do not recover the stellar
rotation period in the variability of various circumstellar lines, such as

in its power spectrum at the period 10.95 years, which is the average solar
cycle period for the interval SC10-SC23. The PC2 time series of the same cycles
has a clear peak at period 21.90 (Hale cycle) and a smaller peak at 3/4 of that
period. We also study the principal component of sunspot numbers (SSN) for
cycles 10-23, and compare mutual behavior of the PC2 components of aa-index and
SSN PCA analyses. We note that they are in the same phase in all other cycles
than Solar Cycles 15 and 20. The aa cycle 20 also differs from other even aa
cycles in its shape, especially in anomalously high peaks during its descending
phase. Even though there is a coherence in the PC2 time series phases of
aa-index and sunspot number, this effect is too small to cause all of the
difference of the shape of even and odd aa cycles. We estimate that 30% of the
shape of the PC2 component of aa-index is due to sunspot number and the rest to
other recurrent events in Sun/solar-wind. The first maximum of aa-data (typical
to odd cycles), during sunspot maximum, has been shown to be related to coronal
mass ejections (CME), while the second maximum (typical to even cycles) in the
declining phase of cycle, is probably related to high-speed streams (HSS). The

precision digital domain has made a lot of progress in theory and practice,
this article is a part of it. It aims to improve and expand the theoretical and
application framework of higher-dimensional digital chaotic system (HDDCS). In
this study, topological mixing for HDDCS is strictly proved theoretically at
first. Topological mixing implies Devaney's definition of chaos in compact
space, but not vise versa. Therefore, the proof of topological mixing improves
and expands the theoretical framework of HDDCS. Then, a general design method
for constructing HDDCS via loop-state contraction algorithm is given. The
construction of the iterative function uncontrolled by random sequences
(hereafter called iterative function) is the starting point of this research.
On this basis, this article put forward a general design method to solve the
problem of HDDCS construction, and a number of examples illustrate the
effectiveness and feasibility of this method. The adjacency matrix
corresponding to the designed HDDCS is used to construct the chaotic echo state
network (ESN) for the Mackey-Glass time series prediction. The prediction

In\nthis study, topological mixing for HDDCS is strictly proved theoretically at\nfirst. Topological mixing implies Devaney's definition of chaos in compact\nspace, but not vise versa. Therefore, the proof of topological mixing improves\nand expands the theoretical framework of HDDCS. Then, a general design method\nfor constructing HDDCS via loop-state contraction algorithm is given. The\nconstruction of the iterative function uncontrolled by random sequences\n(hereafter called iterative function) is the starting point of this research.\nOn this basis, this article put forward a general design method to solve the\nproblem of HDDCS construction, and a number of examples illustrate the\neffectiveness and feasibility of this method. The adjacency matrix\ncorresponding to the designed HDDCS is used to construct the chaotic echo state\nnetwork (ESN) for the Mackey-Glass time series prediction.

activities allows scientists to gain more insight into social species
behaviors. However, by using only time series of activities data, inferring
leadership as manifested by the initiation of coordinated activities faces many
challenging issues. First, coordinated activities are dynamic and are changing
over time. Second, several different coordinated activities might occur
simultaneously among subgroups. Third, there is no fundamental concept to
describe these activities computationally. In this paper, we formalize Faction
Initiator Inference Problem and propose a leadership inference framework as a
solution of this problem. The framework makes no assumption about the
characteristics of a leader or the parameters of the coordination process. The
framework performs better than our non-trivial baseline in both simulated and
biological datasets (schools of fish). Moreover, we demonstrate the application
of our framework as a tool to study group merging and splitting dynamics on
another biological dataset of trajectories of wild baboons. In addition, our
problem formalization and framework enable opportunities for scientists to
analyze coordinated activities and generate scientific hypotheses about
collective behaviors that can be tested statistically and in the field.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=11000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Leadership plays a key role in social animals, including humans,\ndecision-making and coalescence in coordinated activities such as hunting,\nmigration, sport, diplomatic negotiation etc. In these coordinated activities,\nleadership is a process that organizes interactions among members to make a\ngroup achieve collective goals.

structural econometric model as variable of interest or instrument. We apply
our method to study the effects of fiscal foresight, in particular the
informational content in speeches of the U.S. president about future tax

devices generate substantial amounts of multivariate time series data.

Temporal Logic Neural Network (wSTL-NN) that combines the characteristics of
neural networks and temporal logics. Weighted Signal Temporal Logic (wSTL)
formulas are recursively composed of subformulas that are combined using
logical and temporal operators. The quantitative semantics of wSTL is defined
such that the quantitative satisfaction of subformulas with higher weights has
more influence on the quantitative satisfaction of the overall wSTL formula. In
the wSTL-NN, each neuron corresponds to a wSTL subformula, and its output
corresponds to the quantitative satisfaction of the formula. We use wSTL-NN to

investor that invests in a risky asset and manages risk by using Value-at-Risk
(VaR). The VaR is estimated by using past data via an adaptive expectation
scheme. We show that the leverage dynamics can be described by a dynamical
system of slow-fast type associated with a unimodal map on [0,1] with an
additive heteroscedastic noise whose variance is related to the portfolio
rebalancing frequency to target leverage. In absence of noise the model is
purely deterministic and the parameter space splits in two regions: (i) a
region with a globally attracting fixed point or a 2-cycle; (ii) a dynamical
core region, where the map could exhibit chaotic behavior. Whenever the model
is randomly perturbed, we prove the existence of a unique stationary density
with bounded variation, the stochastic stability of the process and the almost
certain existence and continuity of the Lyapunov exponent for the stationary
measure. We then use deep neural networks to estimate map parameters from a
short time series. Using this method, we estimate the model in a large dataset
of US commercial banks over the period 2001-2014. We find that the parameters
of a substantial fraction of banks lie in the dynamical core, and their
leverage time series are consistent with a chaotic behavior. We also present

We also modelled the\nlight curves of four eclipsing binaries (V4, V5, V7, and V8), and gave the\nparameters of the systems; the contact binaries V7 and V8 have distances\nconsistent with that of the cluster. NGC 6397 appears to harbour no RR Lyrae\nstars, being its horizontal branch remarkably blue, much like that of its\nanalogous cluster, M10. To match the blue tail of the horizontal branch\npopulation, models of 0.64--0.66 $M_\\odot$ with mass loss at the RGB are\nrequired, indicating rather thin shell masses for the HB stars.""}","[{'name': 'J.

used for prediction for reaction to sudden and unusual outbreaks. However, most
studies rely only on the UGC as their resource and do not use various UGCs. Our

the best? What combination of multiple UGCs works well? What is the nature of

search engines (Yahoo! Japan), (4) shopping services (Yahoo! Shopping), and (5)
Q&A services (Yahoo! Chiebukuro) as resources of each model. We then validate
respective resources contributions using the best model, Huber Regression, with
all resources except one resource. Finally, we use Bayesian change point method
for ascertaining whether the trend of time series on any resources is reflected
in the trend of flu patient count or not. Our experiments show Huber Regression
model based on various data resources produces the most accurate results. Then,
from the change point analysis, we get the result that search query logs and
social media posts for three years represents these resources as a good
predictor. Conclusions: We show that Huber Regression based on various data
resources is strong for outliers and is suitable for the flu prediction.
Additionally, we indicate the characteristics of each resource for the flu
prediction.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=11000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Influenza, an infectious disease, causes many deaths worldwide.

existential threat to the habitability of any planet in orbit in addition to
making said planets more difficult to detect. M dwarfs do not lose angular
momentum as easily as earlier-type stars, which maintain the high levels of
stellar activity for far longer. Studying young, fast-rotating M dwarfs is key
to understanding their near stellar environment and the evolution of activity
Aims: We study stellar activity on the fast-rotating M dwarf GJ 3270. Methods:
We analyzed dedicated high cadence, simultaneous, photometric and
high-resolution spectroscopic observations obtained with CARMENES of GJ 3270
over 7.7 h, covering a total of eight flares of which two are strong enough to
facilitate a detailed analysis. We consult the TESS data, obtained in the month
prior to our own observations, to study rotational modulation and to compare
the TESS flares to those observed in our campaign. Results: The TESS data
exhibit rotational modulation with a period of 0.37 d. The strongest flare
covered by our observing campaign released a total energy of about 3.6e32 erg,
putting it close to the superflare regime. This flare is visible in the B,V, r,
i, and z photometric bands, which allows us to determine a peak temperature of
about 10,000 K. The flare also leaves clear marks in the spectral time series.
In particular, we observe an evolving, mainly blue asymmetry in chromospheric
lines, which we attribute to a post-flare, corotating feature. To our knowledge
this is the first time such a feature has been seen on a star other than our
Sun. Conclusions: Our photometric and spectroscopic time series covers the
eruption of a strong flare followed up by a corotating feature analogous to a

turbulence as they navigate the ocean. To survive they must avoid predation and
find efficient energy sources. A major difficulty in analysing possible
survival strategies is that the time series of environmental cues in non-linear
flow is complex, and that it depends on the decisions taken by the organism.
One way of determining and evaluating optimal strategies is reinforcement
learning. In a proof-of-principle study, Colabrese et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett.
(2017)] used this method to find out how a micro-swimmer in a vortex flow can
navigate towards the surface as quickly as possible, given a fixed swimming

flow vorticity in the laboratory frame, and reacted to these cues by swimming
either left, right, up, or down. However, usually a motile microorganism
measures the local flow rather than global information, and it can only react
in relation to the local flow, because in general it cannot access global
information (such as up or down in the laboratory frame). Here we analyse
optimal strategies with local signals and actions that do not refer to the

time series forecasting from the perspective of compressed sensing. They
proposed a no-learning method, named Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization
(CNNM), and proved that CNNM can exactly recover the future part of a series
from its observed part, provided that the series is convolutionally low-rank.
While impressive, the convolutional low-rankness condition may not be satisfied
whenever the series is far from being seasonal, and is in fact brittle to the
presence of trends and dynamics. This paper tries to approach the issues by
integrating a learnable, orthonormal transformation into CNNM, with the purpose
for converting the series of involute structures into regular signals of
convolutionally low-rank. We prove that the resulted model, termed
Learning-Based CNNM (LbCNNM), strictly succeeds in identifying the future part
of a series, as long as the transform of the series is convolutionally
low-rank. To learn proper transformations that may meet the required success
conditions, we devise an interpretable method based on Principal Component
Purist (PCP). Equipped with this learning method and some elaborate data
argumentation skills, LbCNNM not only can handle well the major components of
time series (including trends, seasonality and dynamics), but also can make use
of the forecasts provided by some other forecasting methods; this means LbCNNM

They\nproposed a no-learning method, named Convolution Nuclear Norm Minimization\n(CNNM), and proved that CNNM can exactly recover the future part of a series\nfrom its observed part, provided that the series is convolutionally low-rank.\nWhile impressive, the convolutional low-rankness condition may not be satisfied\nwhenever the series is far from being seasonal, and is in fact brittle to the\npresence of trends and dynamics. This paper tries to approach the issues by\nintegrating a learnable, orthonormal transformation into CNNM, with the purpose\nfor converting the series of involute structures into regular signals of\nconvolutionally low-rank. We prove that the resulted model, termed\nLearning-Based CNNM (LbCNNM), strictly succeeds in identifying the future part\nof a series, as long as the transform of the series is convolutionally\nlow-rank. To learn proper transformations that may meet the required success\nconditions, we devise an interpretable method based on Principal Component\nPurist (PCP). Equipped with this learning method and some elaborate data\nargumentation skills, LbCNNM not only can handle well the major components of\ntime series (including trends, seasonality and dynamics), but also can make use\nof the forecasts provided by some other forecasting methods; this means LbCNNM\ncan be used as a general tool for model combination.

This
article is concerned with a system identification problem arising in stochastic
dynamic systems, where the aim is to estimating the parameters of a system
along with its unknown noise processes. In particular, we propose a Bayesian
nonparametric approach for system identification in discrete time nonlinear
random dynamical systems assuming only the order of the Markov process is
known. The proposed method replaces the assumption of Gaussian distributed
error components with a highly flexible family of probability density functions
based on Bayesian nonparametric priors. Additionally, the functional form of
the system is estimated by leveraging Bayesian neural networks which also leads
to flexible uncertainty quantification. Asymptotically on the number of hidden

operation of machines in order to detect undesired states, adjust maintenance
schedules, optimize system performance or collect usage statistics of
individual machines. In this work, we focus on estimating the power output of a
Combined Heat and Power (CHP) machine of a medium-sized company facility by
analyzing the total facility power consumption. We formulate the problem as a
time-series classification problem where the class label represents the CHP
power output. As the facility is fully instrumented and sensor measurements
from the CHP are available, we generate the training labels in an automated
fashion from the CHP sensor readings. However, sensor failures result in
mislabeled training data samples which are hard to detect and remove from the
dataset. Therefore, we propose a novel multi-task deep learning approach that
jointly trains a classifier and an autoencoder with a shared embedding
representation. The proposed approach targets to gradually correct the
mislabelled data samples during training in a self-supervised fashion, without
any prior assumption on the amount of label noise. We benchmark our approach on
several time-series classification datasets and find it to be comparable and
sometimes better than state-of-the-art methods. On the real-world use-case of
predicting the CHP power output, we thoroughly evaluate the architectural
design choices and show that the final architecture considerably increases the

The proper

understanding the spatiotemporal distribution of check-ins and check-outs is

contributions from deep learning and distance-based predictors show limited
success on forecasting bike sharing demand. This consistent observation is
hypothesized to be driven by: i) the strong dependence between demand and the
meteorological and situational context of stations; and ii) the absence of
spatial awareness as most predictors are unable to model the effects of
high-low station load on nearby stations.
  This work proposes a comprehensive set of new principles to incorporate both
historical and prospective sources of spatial, meteorological, situational and
calendrical context in predictive models of station demand. To this end, a new
recurrent neural network layering composed by serial long-short term memory
(LSTM) components is proposed with two major contributions: i) the feeding of
multivariate time series masks produced from historical context data at the
input layer, and ii) the time-dependent regularization of the forecasted time

incorporating different sources of context, showing the relevance of the

This consistent observation is\nhypothesized to be driven by: i) the strong dependence between demand and the\nmeteorological and situational context of stations; and ii) the absence of\nspatial awareness as most predictors are unable to model the effects of\nhigh-low station load on nearby stations.\n  This work proposes a comprehensive set of new principles to incorporate both\nhistorical and prospective sources of spatial, meteorological, situational and\ncalendrical context in predictive models of station demand. To this end, a new\nrecurrent neural network layering composed by serial long-short term memory\n(LSTM) components is proposed with two major contributions: i) the feeding of\nmultivariate time series masks produced from historical context data at the\ninput layer, and ii) the time-dependent regularization of the forecasted time\nseries using prospective context data. This work further assesses the impact of\nincorporating different sources of context, showing the relevance of the\nproposed principles for the community even though not all improvements from the\ncontext-aware predictors yield statistical significance.'}","[{'name': 'Cláudio Sardinha'}, {'name': 'Anna C.

coordinating inverter-based resources (IBR) with utility-owned voltage
regulators (VR) to regulate voltage in unbalanced 3-phase distribution systems.
First, correlations between nodal voltages are derived from nodal voltage
sensitivity studies. Then, the feeder is partitioned into non-overlapping,
weakly-coupled voltage control zones based on nodal voltage correlations. IBR
are used in the first stage to regulate voltage changes continuously and VR are
used in the second stage to regulate large voltage deviations. An online VR
voltage setpoint tuning strategy is developed to reduce excessive tap changes
and avoid large voltage fluctuations without retrofitting existing VR
controllers. In addition, the proposed algorithm uses real-time voltage
measurements only from the critical nodes (typically less than 4% of total
nodes) to reduce the sensing and communication needs. Actual distribution
feeder topologies and load and PV time-series data are used to verify the
performance of the algorithm. Because the method is a rule-based approach, it
runs extremely fast, requires fewer measurements, and requires no retrofit to
the existing VR control mechanisms. Simulation results show that the

empirical data of real stochastic time series. Though the financial markets
provide us with a vast amount of empirical data, the best model selection is
still a big challenge for researchers. The widely used long-range memory and
self-similarity estimators give varying values of the parameters as these
estimators themselves are developed for the specific models of time series.
Here we investigate the order disbalance time series constructed from the limit
order book data of the financial markets under fractional L\'{e}vy stable
motion assumption. Our results suggest that previous findings of persistence in
order flow are related to the power-law distribution of order sizes. Still,
orders have stable estimates of anti-correlation for the 18 randomly selected
stocks, when Absolute value and Higuchi's estimators are implemented. The burst

The vertical approach finds anomalies\nin each protocol space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time\nnode-level features have been used in honeypot aided NADS. Furthermore, using\nextreme value theory, anomaly detection with low false positive rates is\npossible. Experimental results indicate the efficacy of our framework in\nidentifying suspicious activities of nodes from node-level features, often\nbefore the honeypot does.'}","[{'name': 'Sevvandi Kandanaarachchi'}, {'name': 'Hideya Ochiai'}, {'name': 'Asha Rao'}]",{'name': 'Asha Rao'},Asha Rao,8 pages,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02526v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02526v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.CR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.CR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,

stations and one Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) station in Svalbard.

  We found that estimates of the annual signal in different GNSS solutions
disagree by more than 3 mm which makes geophysical interpretation of raw GNSS
time series problematic. To overcome this problem, we have used an enhanced the
Common Mode (CM) filtering technique. The time series are differentiated by the
time series from remote station BJOS with known mass loading signals removed a
priori. Using this technique, we have achieved a substantial reduction of the
differences between the GNSS solutions.
  We have computed mass loading time series from a regional Climatic Mass
Balance (CMB) and snow model that provides the amount of water equivalent at a
1 km resolution with a time step of 7 days. We found that the entire vertical
loading signal is present in data of two totally independent techniques at a
statistically significant level of 95%. This allowed us to conclude that the
remaining errors in vertical signal derived from the CMB model are less than
0.2 mm at that significance level.
  Refining the land water storage loading model with a CMB model resulted in a
reduction of the annual amplitude from 2.1 mm to 1.1 mm in the CM filtered time

around low-mass stars. However, the detection of such planets is challenged by
the short-term activity of the host stars. Aims. The HArps-N red Dwarf
Exoplanet Survey (HADES) program is a long-term project at the Telescopio
Nazionale Galileo aimed at the monitoring of nearby, early-type, M dwarfs,
using the HARPS-N spectrograph to search for small, rocky planets. Methods. A
total of 174 HARPS-N spectroscopic observations of the M0.5V-type star GJ 9689
taken over the past seven years have been analysed. We combined these data with
photometric measurements to disentangle signals related to the stellar activity
of the star from possible Keplerian signals in the radial velocity data. We run
an MCMC analysis, applying Gaussian Process regression techniques to model the
signals present in the data. Results. We identify two periodic signals in the
radial velocity time series, with periods of 18.27 d, and 39.31 d. The analysis
of the activity indexes, photometric data, and wavelength dependency of the
signals reveals that the 39.31 d signal corresponds to the stellar rotation
period. On the other hand, the 18.27 d signal shows no relation to any activity
proxy or the first harmonic of the rotation period. We, therefore, identify it
as a genuine Keplerian signal. The best-fit model describing the newly found
planet, GJ 9689 b, corresponds to an period P$_{\rm b}$ = 18.27 $\pm$ 0.01 d,

to generate hierarchical semantic concepts as the interpretable and

disentanglement strategies by covering both individual latent factors and group
semantic segments. We further theoretically show how to alleviate the KL
vanishing problem: DTS introduces a mutual information maximization term, while
preserving a heavier penalty on the total correlation and the dimension-wise KL

can be formalized as a multi-task multi-view learning problem. Each specific
task consists of multiple shared feature views collected from multiple sources,
either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Common among recent approaches is to
employ a typical hard/soft sharing strategy at the initial phase separately for
each view across tasks to uncover common knowledge, underlying the assumption
that all views are conditionally independent. On the one hand, multiple views
across tasks possibly relate to each other under practical situations. On the
other hand, supervised methods might be insufficient when labeled data is
scarce. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel framework ASM2TV for
semi-supervised multi-task multi-view learning. We present a new perspective
named gating control policy, a learnable task-view-interacted sharing policy
that adaptively selects the most desirable candidate shared block for any view
across any task, which uncovers more fine-grained task-view-interacted
relatedness and improves inference efficiency. Significantly, our proposed
gathering consistency adaption procedure takes full advantage of large amounts
of unlabeled fragmented time-series, making it a general framework that
accommodates a wide range of applications. Experiments on two diverse

The aim is to obtain a cyclic plan over a given tactical planning horizon that
satisfies predicted demand at a minimum cost. A central input to the planning
process is the periodic demand, that is, the demand expected to repeat in every
period in the planning horizon. We focus on large-scale tactical planning
problems that require deterministic models for computational tractability. The
problem of estimating periodic demand in this setting broadly present in
practice has hitherto been overlooked in the literature. We address this gap by
formally introducing the periodic demand estimation problem and propose a
two-step methodology: Based on time series forecasts obtained in the first
step, we propose, in the second step, to solve a multilevel mathematical
programming formulation whose solution is a periodic demand estimate that
minimizes fixed costs, and variable costs incurred by adapting the tactical
plan at an operational level. We report results in an extensive empirical study

We compare our periodic demand estimates to the approach commonly used in
practice which simply consists in using the mean of the time series forecasts.
The results clearly show the importance of the periodic demand estimation
problem. Indeed, the planning costs exhibit an important variation over
different periodic demand estimates, and using an estimate different from the

typically accomplished by deriving coarse variables that summarize the

textbook by John Cochrane (2001). First, we believe that any economic averaging
procedure implies aggregation of corresponding time series during certain time
interval ${\Delta}$ and explain the necessity to use math expectation for both
sides of the main CAPM equation. Second, the first-order condition of utility
max used to derive main CAPM equation should be complemented by the second one
that requires negative utility second derivative. Both define the amount of
assets ${\xi}_{max}$ that delivers max to utility. Expansions of the utility in
a Taylor series by price and payoff variations give approximations for
${\xi}_{max}$ and uncover equations on price, payoff, volatility, skewness,
their covariance's and etc. We discuss why market price-volume positive
correlations may prohibit existence of ${\xi}_{max}$ and main CAPM equation.
Third, we argue that the economic sense of the conventional frequency-based
price probability may be poor. To overcome this trouble we propose new price
probability measure based on widely used volume weighted average price (VWAP).
To forecast price volatility one should predict evolution of squares of the
value and the volume of market trades aggregated during averaging interval
${\Delta}$. The forecast of the new price probability measure may be the main
tough puzzle for CAPM and finance. However investors are free to chose any

coherence time series, and then forecasts a probability distribution of the
coherence between pre- and post-event SAR images. The difference between the
forecast and observed co-event coherence provides a measure of the confidence
in the identification of damage. The method allows the user to choose a damage
detection threshold that is customized for each location, based on the local
behavior of coherence through time before the event. We apply this method to
calculate estimates of damage for three earthquakes using multi-year time

stars for any light curve morphology. These properties suggest different
magnetic field structures at the surface of early-type and later-type stars. We
also detected a dearth of some disk-driven variability behaviors, particularly
dippers, among stars earlier than G. This indicates that their higher surface
temperatures and more chaotic magnetic fields prevent the formation and

examined the characteristic variability timescales within each light curve, and

spectrum. K2 and Kepler observations show that the RMS flicker due to this
Mid-Frequency Continuum (MFC) can reach almost 1%, approaching the modulation
amplitude from active regions. The MFC amplitude varies by a factor up to 40
among Pleiades members with similar Teff, depending mainly on the stellar
Rossby number Ro. For Ro<0.04, the mean amplitude is roughly constant at about
0.4%; at larger Ro the amplitude decreases rapidly, shrinking by about two
orders of magnitude for Ro~1. Among stars, the MFC amplitude correlates poorly
with that of modulation from rotating active regions. Among field stars
observed for 3 years by Kepler, the quarterly average modulation amplitudes
from active regions are much more time-variable than the quarterly MFC
amplitudes. We argue that the process causing the MFC is largely magnetic in
nature, and that its power-law spectrum comes from magnetic processes distinct
from the star's global dynamo, with shorter timescales. By analogy with solar

(NH) surface air temperature trends it is important to have reliable estimates
of both quantities. 16 different TSI estimates were compiled from the
literature. 1/2 of these estimates are low variability and 1/2 are high
variability. 5 largely-independent methods for estimating NH temperature trends
were evaluated using: 1) only rural weather stations; 2) all available stations
whether urban or rural (the standard approach); 3) only sea surface
temperatures; 4) tree-ring temperature proxies; 5) glacier length temperature
proxies. The standard estimates using urban as well as rural stations were
anomalous as they implied a much greater warming in recent decades than the
other estimates. This suggests urbanization bias might still be a problem in
current global temperature datasets despite the conclusions of some earlier
studies. Still, all 5 estimates confirm it is currently warmer than the late
19th century, i.e., there has been some global warming since 1850. For the 5
estimates of NH temperatures, the contribution from direct solar forcing for
all 16 estimates of TSI was evaluated using simple linear least-squares
fitting. The role of human activity in recent warming was then calculated by
fitting the residuals to the UN IPCC's recommended anthropogenic forcings time
series. For all 5 NH temperature series, different TSI estimates implied
everything from recent global warming being mostly human-caused to it being
mostly natural. It seems previous studies (including the most recent IPCC
reports) that had prematurely concluded the former failed to adequately
consider all the relevant estimates of TSI and/or to satisfactorily address the

after momentum turning points, where a trend reverses from an uptrend
(downtrend) to a downtrend (uptrend), time-series momentum (TSMOM) strategies

introduce a novel approach, where we insert an online change-point detection

uses an LSTM deep-learning architecture to simultaneously learn both trend
estimation and position sizing. Furthermore, our model is able to optimise the
way in which it balances 1) a slow momentum strategy which exploits persisting
trends, but does not overreact to localised price moves, and 2) a fast
mean-reversion strategy regime by quickly flipping its position, then swapping
it back again to exploit localised price moves. Our CPD module outputs a
changepoint location and severity score, allowing our model to learn to respond
to varying degrees of disequilibrium, or smaller and more localised
changepoints, in a data driven manner. Using a portfolio of 50, liquid,
continuous futures contracts over the period 1990-2020, the addition of the CPD

this module is especially beneficial in periods of significant nonstationarity,

The method\nproposed uses advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) voltage and derived active\npower measurements at the customer level, and data acquisition systems (DAS)\nmeasurements at the feeder-head, in conjunction with an AC optimal power flow\n(ACOPF) to estimate customer active and reactive power consumption over a time\nhorizon, while accounting for unmetered loads. Additionally, the method\nproposed estimates both voltage magnitude and angle for each phase at the\nunbalanced distribution substation. Furthermore, the accuracy of the method\ndeveloped is verified by comparing the time-series power flow results obtained\nfrom the enhancement algorithm with OpenDSS results. The proposed approach\nseamlessly manages the data available from the optimization procedure through\nthe final model verification automatically.'}","[{'name': 'Karen Montano-Martinez'}, {'name': 'Student Member'}, {'name': 'IEEE'}, {'name': 'Sushrut Thakar'}, {'name': 'Student Member'}, {'name': 'IEEE'}, {'name': 'Shanshan Ma'}, {'name': 'Member'}, {'name': 'IEEE'}, {'name': 'Zahra Soltani'}, {'name': 'Student Member'}, {'name': 'IEEE'}, {'name': 'Vijay Vittal'}, {'name': 'Life Fellow'}, {'name': 'IEEE'}, {'name': 'Mojdeh Khorsand'}, {'name': 'Member'}, {'name': 'IEEE'}, {'name': 'Raja Ayyanar'}, {'name': 'Senior Member'}, {'name': 'IEEE'}, {'name': 'Cynthia Rojas'}, {'name': 'Member'}, {'name': 'IEEE'}]",{'name': 'IEEE'},IEEE,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14161v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.14161v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'eess.SY', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'eess.SY', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.SY', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'math.OC', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,

underpins many information retrieval tasks. Successful TLS requires identifying
an appropriate set of key dates (the timeline length) to cover. However, doing
so is challenging as the right length can change from one topic to another.
Existing TLS solutions either rely on an event-agnostic fixed length or an
expert-supplied setting. Neither of the strategies is desired for real-life TLS
scenarios. A fixed, event-agnostic setting ignores the diversity of events and
their development and hence can lead to low-quality TLS. Relying on
expert-crafted settings is neither scalable nor sustainable for processing many

automatically and dynamically determining the TLS timeline length. We achieve
this by employing the established elbow method from the machine learning

information as much as possible and ensure that the extracted feature embedding
and other modal feature embedding have an excellent mutual understanding. The
latter is often more critical in feature fusion than the former. Therefore,
selecting the optimal feature extraction network collocation is a very
important subproblem in multimodal tasks. Most of the existing studies ignore
this problem or adopt an ergodic approach. This problem is modeled as an
optimization problem in this paper. A novel method is proposed to convert the
optimization problem into an issue of comparative upper bounds by referring to
the general practice of extreme value conversion in mathematics. Compared with
the traditional method, it reduces the time cost.

problems. However, practitioners are not only interested in point predictions,

the predictions. Creating such probabilistic predictions is difficult with
existing GBM-based solutions: they either require training multiple models or
they become too computationally expensive to be useful for large-scale
settings. We propose Probabilistic Gradient Boosting Machines (PGBM), a method
to create probabilistic predictions with a single ensemble of decision trees in
a computationally efficient manner. PGBM approximates the leaf weights in a
decision tree as a random variable, and approximates the mean and variance of
each sample in a dataset via stochastic tree ensemble update equations. These
learned moments allow us to subsequently sample from a specified distribution
after training. We empirically demonstrate the advantages of PGBM compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods: (i) PGBM enables probabilistic estimates
without compromising on point performance in a single model, (ii) PGBM learns
probabilistic estimates via a single model only (and without requiring
multi-parameter boosting), and thereby offers a speedup of up to several orders
of magnitude over existing state-of-the-art methods on large datasets, and
(iii) PGBM achieves accurate probabilistic estimates in tasks with complex
differentiable loss functions, such as hierarchical time series problems, where

In the\nexperimental evaluation, we use a novel setting to test if our method and\nbaseline methods can exhaustively catch all real-world news in the test period.\nThe evaluation results show that when the event is quite unusual with regard to\nthe base social media discussion, it can be captured more effectively with our\nmethod. Our method can be easily implemented and can be treated as a starting\npoint for more specific applications.'}","[{'name': 'Yihong Zhang'}, {'name': 'Masumi Shirakawa'}, {'name': 'Takahiro Hara'}]",{'name': 'Takahiro Hara'},Takahiro Hara,"Accepted for presentation in the 25th European Conference on Advances

Here we demonstrate the software's capabilities by\nexploring the effect of measuring time delays from lensed quasars and\nsupernovae in many wavelengths and under different microlensing and intrinsic\nvariability assumptions. In this initial application, we find that the cadence\nof the observations and combining information from different wavelengths plays\nan important role in the correct recovery of the time delays.

under the assumption that the LISA armlengths are constant or evolve linearly
with time, respectively. We recently extended TDI by solving for the
laser-noise-free combinations implicitly, writing the likelihood of the data

unrealistic, they do not invalidate the algorithm, since one can simply
truncate the design matrix to exclude ""incomplete'' measurements, or set them

periodic signals in time- and frequency-resolved data from radio telescopes.
The complexity and computational expense of simultaneously determining the
frequency-dependent delay (dispersion) and the periodicity of the signal is
further exacerbated by the presence of various types of radio-frequency
interference (RFI) and observing-system effects. New observing systems with
wider bandwidths, higher bit rates and greater overall sensitivity (also to
RFI) further enhance these challenges. We present a novel approach to the
analysis of pulsar search data. Specifically, we present a neural-network-based
pipeline that efficiently suppresses a wide range of RFI signals and
instrumental instabilities and furthermore corrects for (a priori unknown)
interstellar dispersion. After initial training of the network, our analysis
can be run in real time on a standard desktop computer with a commonly
available, consumer-grade GPU. We complement our neural network with standard
algorithms for periodicity searches. In particular with the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT) and the Fast Folding Algorithm (FFA) and demonstrate that with
these straightforward extensions, our method is capable of identifying even
faint pulsars, while maintaining an extremely low number of false positives. We
furthermore apply our analysis to a subset of the PALFA survey and demonstrate

computed tomography (4DCT) of lungs and are caused by missing, duplicated, and
misaligned image data. This paper presents a geodesic density regression (GDR)
algorithm to correct motion artifacts in 4DCT by correcting artifacts in one
breathing phase with artifact-free data from corresponding regions of other
breathing phases. The GDR algorithm estimates an artifact-free lung template
image and a smooth, dense, 4D (space plus time) vector field that deforms the
template image to each breathing phase to produce an artifact-free 4DCT scan.
Correspondences are estimated by accounting for the local tissue density change
associated with air entering and leaving the lungs, and using binary artifact
masks to exclude regions with artifacts from image regression. The
artifact-free lung template image is generated by mapping the artifact-free
regions of each phase volume to a common reference coordinate system using the
estimated correspondences and then averaging. This procedure generates a fixed
view of the lung with an improved signal-to-noise ratio. The GDR algorithm was
evaluated and compared to a state-of-the-art geodesic intensity regression
(GIR) algorithm using simulated CT time-series and 4DCT scans with clinically
observed motion artifacts. The simulation shows that the GDR algorithm has
achieved significantly more accurate Jacobian images and sharper template
images, and is less sensitive to data dropout than the GIR algorithm. We also
demonstrate that the GDR algorithm is more effective than the GIR algorithm for
removing clinically observed motion artifacts in treatment planning 4DCT scans.

approach to this has been the use of function learning paradigms, which allow
peoples' empirical patterns of generalization for smooth scalar functions to be
described precisely. However, to date, such work has not succeeded in
identifying mechanisms that acquire the kinds of general purpose
representations over which function learning can operate to exhibit the
patterns of generalization observed in human empirical studies. Here, we
present a framework for how a learner may acquire such representations, that
then support generalization -- and extrapolation in particular -- in a few-shot

Recent developments in abdominal cine-MRI have enabled the non-invasive

management of patients with pain. Detection of abdominal adhesions on cine-MRI
is challenging from both a radiological and deep learning perspective. We focus
on classifying presence or absence of adhesions in sagittal abdominal cine-MRI
series. We experimented with spatio-temporal deep learning architectures
centered around a ConvGRU architecture. A hybrid architecture comprising a
ResNet followed by a ConvGRU model allows to classify a whole time-series.
Compared to a stand-alone ResNet with a two time-point (inspiration/expiration)
input, we show an increase in classification performance (AUROC) from 0.74 to
0.83 ($p<0.05$). Our full temporal classification approach adds only a small
