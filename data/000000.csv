theory, bleached data avoids these pitfalls. But in practice, bleaching
obscures the underlying deterministic structure of a low-dimensional chaotic

spectral analyses of aircraft lidar measurements of phytoplankton abundance

As a model for this observation, I consider a stochastic growth equation where
the rate of change of plankton abundance is determined by turbulent mixing,
modeled as a diffusion process in two dimensions, and exponential growth with a
stochastically variable net growth rate representing a fluctuating environment.
The model predicts a lognormal distribution of abundance and a power spectrum

The model equation predicts that the power spectrum of variations in abundance
in time at a point in space is $S(f)\propto f^{-1.5}$ (where $f$ is the
frequency). Time series analysis of local variations of phytoplankton and
zooplankton yield a power-law power spectrum with exponents -1.3 and -1.2,

in the Sy1 galaxy NGC 5548 and provide a critical comparison with the
predictions of a hydromagnetically-driven outflow model of Emmering, Blandford
and Shlosman. This model was used to generate a time series of CIV line
profiles that have responded to a time varying continuum. The model includes
cloud emission anisotropy, cloud obscuration, a CLOUDY-generated emissivity
function and a narrow-line component used to generate the line profiles, and is
driven with continuum input based on the monitoring campaigns of NGC 5548. The
line strengths, profiles and lags are compared with the observations. It
reproduces the basic features of CIV line variability in this AGN without
varying the model parameters. The best fit model provides the effective size,
the dominant geometry, the emissivity distribution and the 3D velocity field of
the CIV BLR and constrains the mass of the central BH. The inner part of the
wind appears to be responsible for the anisotropically emitted CIV line, while
its outer part remains dusty and molecular, thus having similar spectral
characteristics to a molecular torus, although its dynamics is fundamentally
different. In addition, our model predicts a differential response across the
CIV line profile, producing a red-side-first response in the mid-wings followed
by the blue mid-wing and by the line core. Based on the comparison of data and

instrument for 19k seconds during 1996 March 24th. We applied the
contemporaneous radio ephemeris and various statistical tests to search for
evidence of pulsation. These analyses yield intriguing yet inconclusive
evidence for the presence of the pulsation in the time series: confidence level
for the presence of pulsation is 94.5% in the 2.0-4.8 keV band and 97.6% in the
4.8-6.3 keV band based on the H-test. Under the premise of non-detection of
pulsation, we derive estimated 2-sigma upper limits for the pulsed flux to be
$3.3\times 10^{-6} cm^{-2} s^{-1} keV^{-1}$ in the 2.0-4.8 keV band, $2.7\times

are consistent with the trend of spectral turn-over from high-energy gamma-ray
emission as suggested by the OSSE upper limit. Such turn-over strongly suggests
the outer magnetosphere as the emission site for pulsed gamma-rays. These RXTE
upper limits for X-ray pulsation are, on the other hand, not consistent with
the extrapolation of reported power-law spectra from the point source observed

space-based laser interferometer for measuring low-frequency gravitational
waves from galactic and extragalactic sources. LISA is not a pointed
instrument; it is an all-sky monitor with a quadrupolar beam pattern. LISA will
measure simultaneously both polarization components of incoming gravitational
waves, so the data will consist of two time series. All physical properties of
the source, including its position, must be extracted from these time series.
LISA's angular resolution is therefore not a fixed quantity, but rather depends
on the type of signal and on how much other information must be extracted.
Information about the source position will be encoded in the measured signal in
three ways: 1) through the relative amplitudes and phases of the two
polarization components, 2) through the periodic Doppler shift imposed on the
signal by the detector's motion around the Sun, and 3) through the further
modulation of the signal caused by the detector's time-varying orientation. We
derive the basic formulae required to calculate the LISA's angular resolution

two sources of particular interest: monchromatic sources and mergers of
supermassive black holes. For these two types of sources, we calculate (in the
high signal-to-noise approximation) the full variance-covariance matrix, which
gives the accuracy to which all source parameters can be measured. Since our
results on LISA's angular resolution depend mainly on gross features of the
detector geometry, orbit, and noise curve, we expect these results to be fairly

The strength of the inter-hemispheric coupling, which cannot be\nextracted from the average data, is found to be highly variable from subject to\nsubject, but remarkably stable for each subject.'}","[{'name': 'J.

the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope to obtain nearly-continuous,
high-throughput, linear photometry of V2116 Oph in a 7 Angstrom bandpass at the
center of the O I 8446 emission line. This instrumental technique shows promise
for applications requiring precise, rapid, narrowband photometry of faint
objects. The spectrum of V2116 Oph, the counterpart of GX 1+4 (=X1728-247), is
exotic, even among the unusual spectra of other optical counterparts of compact
Galactic X-ray sources. The second strongest emission line is an unusual one,
namely extremely prominent O I 8446, which is likely to result from pumping by
an intense Ly beta radiation field. As the X-radiation from GX 1+4 is steadily
pulsed, with typical pulsed fractions of 0.4, the O I 8446 emission in V2116
Oph may also be strongly modulated with the current 127 s period of the X-ray
source. If so, this may well allow us to obtain high signal-to-noise radial
velocity measurements and thus to determine the system parameters. However, no
such pulsations are detected, and we set an upper limit of ~1% (full-amplitude)
on periodic 8446 oscillations at the X-ray frequency. This value is comparable
to the amplitude of continuum oscillations observed on some nights by other
workers. Thus we rule out an enhancement of the pulsation amplitude in O I
emission, at least at the time of our observations.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=0&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We have used innovative features of the Taurus Tunable Filter instrument on\nthe 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope to obtain nearly-continuous,\nhigh-throughput, linear photometry of V2116 Oph in a 7 Angstrom bandpass at the\ncenter of the O I 8446 emission line.

The second strongest emission line is an unusual one,\nnamely extremely prominent O I 8446, which is likely to result from pumping by\nan intense Ly beta radiation field. As the X-radiation from GX 1+4 is steadily\npulsed, with typical pulsed fractions of 0.4, the O I 8446 emission in V2116\nOph may also be strongly modulated with the current 127 s period of the X-ray\nsource. If so, this may well allow us to obtain high signal-to-noise radial\nvelocity measurements and thus to determine the system parameters. However, no\nsuch pulsations are detected, and we set an upper limit of ~1% (full-amplitude)\non periodic 8446 oscillations at the X-ray frequency. This value is comparable\nto the amplitude of continuum oscillations observed on some nights by other\nworkers. Thus we rule out an enhancement of the pulsation amplitude in O I\nemission, at least at the time of our observations.'}","[{'name': 'Eric W.

almost fifteen years in the homogeneous Geneva photometric system, is
presented. Cluster membership, physical parameters and evolutionary status of
the star are reinvestigated. Radial velocity data do not support the cluster
membership to Stock 14}. Ultraviolet and optical spectrophotometry is combined
with optical and infrared photometry to evaluate the physical parameters of the
yellow supergiant (Teff = 5970 K, M_bol = -8.5, R = 420 R_sun) and of its B0III
companion. From theoretical stellar evolutionary tracks, an initial mass of 25
M_sun is estimated for V810 Cen, which is actually at the end of its first
redward evolution.
  V810 Cen is a multi-periodic small amplitude variable star, whose amplitudes
are variable with time. The period of the main mode, 156 d, is in agreement
with the Period--Luminosity--Colour relation for supergiants. This mode is most
probably the fundamental radial one. According to the theoretical pulsation
periods for the radial modes, calculated from a linear non-adiabatic analysis,
the period of the observed second mode, 107 d, is much too long to correspond
to the first radial overtone . Thus, this second mode could be a non-radial
p-mode. Other transient periods are observed, in particular at 187 d. The l
ength of this period suggests a non-radial g-mode. Then, the complex
variability of V810 Cen could be due to a mixing of unstable radial and
non-radial p- and g-modes.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=0&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The F8Ia supergiant V810 Centauri is part of a long-term high-precision\nphotometric monitoring program on long period variables started twenty years\nago.

analysis (SSA) to the study of nonstationary time series of length $N$ whose
intermittency can give rise to the divergence of their variance. SSA relies on
the construction of the lag-covariance matrix C on M lagged copies of the time
series over a fixed window width W to detect the regular part of the
variability in that window in terms of the minimal number of oscillatory
components; here W = M Dt, with Dt the time step. The proposed multi-scale SSA
is a local SSA analysis within a moving window of width M <= W <= N.
Multi-scale SSA varies W, while keeping a fixed W/M ratio, and uses the
eigenvectors of the corresponding lag-covariance matrix C_M as a data-adaptive

derivatives of the first mother wavelet in standard wavelet analysis.
Multi-scale SSA thus solves objectively the delicate problem of optimizing the
analyzing wavelet in the time-frequency domain, by a suitable localization of
the signal's covariance matrix. We present several examples of application to
synthetic signals with fractal or power-law behavior which mimic selected
features of certain climatic and geophysical time series. A real application is

scattering coherent radiation from materials undergoing spinodal decomposition

For binary systems which obey a local conservation law, the characteristic
domain size is known to grow in time $\tau$ as $R = [B \tau]^n$ with n=1/3,
where B is a constant. The intensities of individual speckles are found to be
nonstationary, persistent time series. The two-time intensity covariance at

construct an unaliased continuous-time series which exactly fits those samples.

differ from those of the ideal homogeneous isotropic model.They

ofinhomogeneous and anisotropic contributions. We employ the recently
introduceddecomposition of statistical tensor objects into irreducible
representations of theSO(3) symmetry group (characterized by $j$ and $m$
indices), to disentangle someof these contributions, separating the universal
and the asymptotic from the specific aspects of the flow. The different $j$
contributions transform differently under rotations and so form a complete

atmospheric surfacelayer. Time series data from single probes and from pairs of
probes are analyzed to compute the amplitudes and exponents of different
contributions to the second order statistical objects characterized by $j=0$,
$j=1$ and $j=2$. The analysis shows the need to make a careful distinction

relatively short-lived 3d motions. We demonstrate that the leading scaling

S I, we treat the important species in the formation of the spectrum in full
NLTE. We present results for both a hydrodynamic model that has been fit to the
light curve and for an illustrative custom crafted model that is more massive.
Both models give reasonable fits to the overall observed spectra; however,
neither is able to reproduce all the observed features. Some conspicuous
observed features are absent and some predicted features are unobserved. No
model that we have explored is able to satisfactorily reproduce the observed
infrared feature near 1 micron on April 15, 1994 (+7d), which has been
attributed to the triplet He I lambda 10830 transition. The low-mass
hydrodynamic model produces an infrared feature with a blend of He I, C I, O I,
and Si I--II lines, but it predicts a strong unobserved absorption feature near
6100 Angstroms due to Fe III, and the observed feature just blueward of 6000
Angstroms most likely due to Na D is not reproduced. The more massive model
does a better job of reproducing the observed infrared lineshape, but also
predicts the unobserved feature near 6100 Angstroms. The early-time spectrum of
the low-mass model is far too blue; thus, a more massive model may be slightly
favored. Since the predicted infrared feature is produced by a blend of so many
elements and there is no overwhelming evidence for other helium features such

flare, where the 2-10 keV flux changed by a factor of 2 on a time scale of 3 x

the Breger polarimeter on the 0.9~m telescope at McDonald Observatory and the
AnyPol polarimeter on the 0.4~m telescope at Limber Observatory, using the
Johnson-Cousins UBVRI broadband filter system. Comparison with earlier
measurements shows no clearly defined long-term polarization variability. For
all 9 stars the wavelength dependence of the degree of polarization in the
optical range can be fit by a normal interstellar polarization law. The
polarization position angles are practically constant with wavelength and are
consistent with those of neighboring stars. Thus the simplest conclusion is
that the polarization of all the program stars is primarily interstellar.
  The O stars chosen for this study are generally known from ultraviolet and
optical spectroscopy to have substantial mass loss rates and variable winds, as
well as occasional circumstellar emission. Their lack of intrinsic polarization
in comparison with the similar Be stars may be explained by the dominance of
radiation as a wind driving force due to higher luminosity, which results in
lower density and less rotational flattening in the electron scattering inner
envelopes where the polarization is produced. However, time series of
polarization measurements taken simultaneously with H-alpha and UV spectroscopy
during several coordinated multiwavelength campaigns suggest two cases of
possible small-amplitude, periodic short-term polarization variability, and
therefore intrinsic polarization, which may be correlated with the more widely
recognized spectroscopic variations.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=0&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'New observations of 9 of the brightest northern O stars have been made with\nthe Breger polarimeter on the 0.9~m telescope at McDonald Observatory and the\nAnyPol polarimeter on the 0.4~m telescope at Limber Observatory, using the\nJohnson-Cousins UBVRI broadband filter system.

The\npolarization position angles are practically constant with wavelength and are\nconsistent with those of neighboring stars. Thus the simplest conclusion is\nthat the polarization of all the program stars is primarily interstellar.\n  The O stars chosen for this study are generally known from ultraviolet and\noptical spectroscopy to have substantial mass loss rates and variable winds, as\nwell as occasional circumstellar emission. Their lack of intrinsic polarization\nin comparison with the similar Be stars may be explained by the dominance of\nradiation as a wind driving force due to higher luminosity, which results in\nlower density and less rotational flattening in the electron scattering inner\nenvelopes where the polarization is produced. However, time series of\npolarization measurements taken simultaneously with H-alpha and UV spectroscopy\nduring several coordinated multiwavelength campaigns suggest two cases of\npossible small-amplitude, periodic short-term polarization variability, and\ntherefore intrinsic polarization, which may be correlated with the more widely\nrecognized spectroscopic variations.'}",[{'name': 'David McDavid'}],{'name': 'David McDavid'},David McDavid,10.1086/301186,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/301186', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9909456v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/9909456v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",AJ 119 (2000) 352-364,"{'term': 'astro-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'astro-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]","LaTeX2e, 22 pages including 11 tables; 12 separate gif figures; uses

spanning a 11-year baseline. The most striking feature of the light curve is a
non-coherent periodic hump of variable amplitude. A seasonal time series
analysis yields a photometric period of 0.0756(12) d. In addition, low
amplitude fluctuations of the mean magnitude in time scale of months are
observed. We find that the hump's amplitude is anti-correlated with the star's
mean magnitude and becomes ""negative"" (i.e. an absorption feature or
""anti-hump"") when the system is very faint. Secondary humps and ""anti-humps""
are also observed. The transition from ""anti-humps"" to fully developed humps
occurs on a time scale of 70 days. We interprete the observations as a rapid
response of the accretion disk to the increase of mass transfer rate. In this
case we deduce a viscosity parameter alpha ~ 0.08, i.e. much larger than often
claimed for WZ Sge-like stars. We note that the secondary star in RZ Leo is
close to a main-sequence red dwarf and not a brown-dwarf like star as suggested
for other long cycle-length SU UMa stars like WZ Sge and V592 Her. Our results

to estimate unknown parameters of a nonlinear dynamical system from a given
scalar chaotic time series. We present an important extension of the method
when time series of a scalar function of the variables of the underlying
dynamical system is given. We find that it is possible to obtain
synchronization as well as parameter estimation using such a time series. We
then consider a general quadratic flow in three dimensions and discuss
applicability of our method of parameter estimation in this case. In practical

caused by these otherwise invisible objects. In 5.7 years of observations

survey, allowing powerful statements to be made about the nature of the dark
population in the halo of our Galaxy. A critical component of these statements

$G^{\prime\prime}(\omega)$ have been measured over a wide frequency range. In
the nonlinear regime, the shear stress $\sigma$ shows a plateau as a function
of the shear rate $\dot\gamma$ above a certain cutoff shear rate
$\dot\gamma_c$. Under controlled shear rate conditions in the plateau regime,
the shear stress and the first normal stress difference show oscillatory
time-dependence. The analysis of the measured time series of shear stress and
normal stress has been done using several methods incorporating state space
reconstruction by embedding of time delay vectors.The analysis shows the

representative of the YY Ori subgroup of T Tauri stars that show conspicuous
inverse PCygni profiles. The data set consists of 32 exposures taken over 5 and
8 consecutive nights of May and July 1998, respectively, and covers the
spectral range of 3100 \AA~ $< \lambda < 5100 $ \AA. The region redward and
next to the Balmer jump varies significantly on a night-to-night basis and the
amplitude of such variability decreases sharply at $\lambda >$ 4600 \AA. The
Balmer continuum slope indicates that the spectral energy distribution is
governed by a gas of temperature greater than that of the stellar photosphere.
We find an anticorrelation between the veiling and the observed Balmer jump.
The time series of the redward absorption component behaves similarly to the
veiling time series. We model the emitting region by a gas of uniform
temperature and density. The models indicate that the gas densities and the
respective temperatures are strongly anticorrelated. In addition, the model

0218+357 yield a time delay of 10.1(+1.5-1.6)days (95% confidence). This is
consistent with independent measurements carried out at the same epoch (Biggs
et al. 1999), lending confidence in the robustness of the time delay
measurement. However, since both measurements make use of the same features in
the light curves, it is possible that the effects of unmodelled processes, such
as scintillation or microlensing, are biasing both time delay measurements in
the same way. Our time delay estimates result in confidence intervals that are
somewhat larger than those of Biggs et al., probably because we adopt a more
general model of the source variability, allowing for constant and variable
components. When considered in relation to the lens mass model of Biggs et al.,
our best-fit time delay implies a Hubble constant of H_o = 71(+17-23) km/s-Mpc

interval for H_o does not reflect systematic error, which may be substantial,
due to uncertainty in the position of the lens galaxy. We also measure the flux
ratio of the variable components of 0218+357, a measurement of a small region
that should more closely represent the true lens magnification ratio. We find
ratios of 3.2(+0.3-0.4) (95% confidence; 8 GHz) and 4.3(+0.5-0.8) (15 GHz).
Unlike the reported flux ratios on scales of 0.1"", these ratios are not
strongly significantly different. We investigate the significance of apparent

the slope deviates from exact linearity and the conclusions become ambiguous

self-affine time series made up of random pulses can show near-linear scaling
over a finite dynamic range such that they could be misinterpreted as being
self-affine. In particular we show that pulses with functional forms such as
those identified by Weimer within the $AL$ index, from which $AE$ is partly

first show that the no-arbitrage condition imposes that the non-diagonal

average, i.e., must exhibit random alternative regimes of reinforcement and
contrarian feedbacks. In contrast, the diagonal terms must be positive and
equal on average to the inverse of the discount factor. Applying the results of
renewal theory for products of random matrices to stochastic recurrence
equations (SRE), we extend the theorem of Lux and Sornette (cond-mat/9910141)

with such d-dimensional bubble processes follow power laws (i.e., exhibit
hyperbolic decline), with the same asymptotic tail exponent mu<1 for all
assets. The distribution of price differences and of returns is dominated by
the same power-law over an extended range of large returns. This small value
mu<1 of the tail exponent has far-reaching consequences in the non-existence of
the means and variances. Although power-law tails are a pervasive feature of
empirical data, the numerical value mu<1 is in disagreement with the usual
empirical estimates mu approximately equal to 3. It, therefore, appears that

explain the variability characteristics in 56-77% of the stars, while the

ion in the interstellar medium of the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds. Along
sightlines to OB-type stars, these interstellar components are usually blended
with O VI stellar wind profiles, which frequently vary in shape. In order to
assess the effects of this time-dependent blending on measurements of the
interstellar O VI lines, we have undertaken a mini-survey of repeated
observations toward OB-type stars in the Galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud.
These sparse time series, which consist of 2-3 observations separated by
intervals ranging from a few days to several months, show that wind variability
occurs commonly in O VI (about 60% of a sample of 50 stars), as indeed it does
in other resonance lines. However, in the interstellar O VI $\lambda$1032
region, the O VI $\lambda$1038 wind varies only in $\sim$30% of the cases. By
examining cases exhibiting large amplitude variations, we conclude that
stellar-wind variability {\em generally} introduces negligible uncertainty for
single interstellar O VI components along Galactic lines of sight, but can
result in substantial errors in measurements of broader components or blends of
components like those typically observed toward stars in the Large Magellanic
Cloud. Due to possible contamination by discrete absorption components in the

cluster NGC 6441 using time-series BV photometry. The total number of variables
found near NGC 6441 has been increased to ~104, with 48 new variables being
found in this survey. A significant number of the variables are RR Lyrae stars
(~46), most of which are probable cluster members. As was noted by Layden et
al. (1999), the periods of the fundamental mode RR Lyrae are unusually long

that the metallicity-luminosity relationship for RR Lyrae stars is not
universal. We discuss the difficulty in determining the Oosterhoff
classification of NGC 6441 due to the unusual nature of its RR Lyrae. A number
of ab-type RR Lyrae are found to be both brighter and redder than the other
probable RRab found along the horizontal branch, which may be a result of
blending with stars of redder color. A smaller than usual gap is found between
the shortest period fundamental mode and longest period first-overtone mode RR
Lyrae. We determine the reddening of the cluster to be E(B-V)=0.51+/-0.02 mag,
with substantial differential reddening across the face of the cluster. The
mean V magnitude of the RR Lyrae is found to be 17.51+/-0.02 mag resulting in a

distance smaller than a given $\tau$ is found. We adopt the paradigm of the
inverse power law behavior, and we focus on the determination of the inverse

might be revealed, at larger scales, with the help of richer statistics. The
second technique, called Diffusion Entropy (DE) method, rests on the evaluation
of the entropy of the diffusion process generated by the time series. The
details of the diffusion process depend on three different walking rules, which
determine the form and the time duration of the transition to the scaling
regime, as well as the scaling parameter $\delta$. With the first two rules the
information contained in the time series is transmitted, to a great extent, to
the transition, as well as to the scaling regime. The same information is
essentially conveyed, by using the third rules, into the scaling regime, which,
in fact, emerges very quickly after a fast transition process. We show that the
significant information hidden within the time series concerns memory induced
by the solar cycle, as well as the power index $\mu$. The scaling parameter
$\delta$ becomes a simple function of $\mu$, when memory is annihilated. Thus,
the three walking rules yield a unique and precise value of $\mu$ if the memory
is wisely taken under control, or cancelled by shuffling the data. All this

from financial return series contain such a high amount of noise that, apart
from a few large eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors, their
structure can essentially be regarded as random. In [1], e.g., it is reported
that about 94% of the spectrum of these matrices can be fitted by that of a
random matrix drawn from an appropriately chosen ensemble. In view of the

under linear constraints) noise has relatively little effect. To leading order
the solutions are determined by the stable, large eigenvalues, and the
displacement of the solution (measured in variance) due to noise is rather
small: depending on the size of the portfolio and on the length of the time
series, it is of the order of 5 to 15%. The picture is completely different,
however, if we attempt to minimize the variance under non-linear constraints,

strong magnetic fields on differential rotation leads to grand minima in the
cyclic activity similar to those observed. Our 2D model contains the large- and
small-scale feedback of magnetic fields on diff. rotation and induction in a
mean-field formulation (Lambda-, alpha-quenching). Grand minima may also occur
if a dynamo occasionally falls below its critical eigenvalue. We never found
any indication that such an on-off dynamo collapses by this effect after being
excited. The full quenching of turbulence by strong magnetic fields as reduced
induction (alpha) and reduced turbulent diffusivity (eta_T) is studied in 1D.
We find a stronger dependence of cycle period on dynamo number compared with a
pure alpha-quenching model giving a very weak cycle period dependence. Also the
temporal fluctuations of alpha and eta_T from a random-vortex simulation were
applied to a dynamo. Then the low `quality' of the solar cycle can be explained
with a small number of giant cells as dynamo-active turbulence. The transition
from almost regular magnetic oscillations (many vortices) to a more or less
chaotic time series (very few vortices) is shown.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=0&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""The theory of the solar/stellar activity cycles is presented, based on the\nmean-field concept in magnetohydrodynamics.

data shows the chloride concentrations in rainfall to have a white noise
spectrum, while in streamflow, the spectrum exhibits a fractal $1/f$ scaling.
The empirically derived distribution of tracer travel times $h(t)$ follows a
power-law, indicating low-level contaminant delivery to streams for a very long
time. Our transport model is based on a continuous time random walk (CTRW) with
an event time distribution governed by $\psi(t)\sim A_{\beta}t^{-1-\beta}$. The
CTRW using this power-law $\psi(t)$ (with $0<\beta<1$) is interchangeable with
the time-fractional advection-dispersion equation (FADE) and has accounted for
the universal phenomenon of anomalous transport in a broad range of disordered
and complex systems. In the current application, the events can be realized as
transit times on portions of the catchment network. The travel time
distribution is the first passage time distribution $F(t; l)$ at a distance $l$
from a pulse input (at $t=0$) at the origin. We show that the empirical $h(t)$

between two random variables $X$ and $Y$ for large or extreme events for
several models of interest for financial time series. The six measures of
dependence are respectively the linear correlation $\rho^+_v$ and Spearman's
rho $\rho_s(v)$ conditioned on signed exceedance of one variable above the
threshold $v$, or on both variables ($\rho_u$), the linear correlation
$\rho^s_v$ conditioned on absolute value exceedance (or large volatility) of
one variable, the so-called asymptotic tail-dependence $\lambda$ and a
probability-weighted tail dependence coefficient ${\bar \lambda}$. The models
are the bivariate Gaussian distribution, the bivariate Student's distribution,
and the factor model for various distributions of the factor. We offer explicit
analytical formulas as well as numerical estimations for these six measures of
dependence in the limit where $v$ and $u$ go to infinity. This provides a
quantitative proof that conditioning on exceedance leads to conditional
correlation coefficients that may be very different from the unconditional
correlation and gives a straightforward mechanism for fluctuations or changes
of correlations, based on fluctuations of volatility or changes of trends.
Moreover, these various measures of dependence exhibit different and sometimes
opposite behaviors, suggesting that, somewhat similarly to risks whose adequate
characterization requires an extension beyond the restricted one-dimensional

For most elements we find abundances somewhat below the Solar values, in\nparticular we find [Fe/H] = -0.13(14). We also present the results from the\nstudy of the variability that is seen in spectroscopic and photometric time\nseries observations. From the characteristics of the variation seen in\nphotometry and in the line profiles we propose that HD 49434 is a variable star\nof the gamma Doradus type.'}","[{'name': 'H. Bruntt'}, {'name': 'C.

its 2001 superoutburst. After a 23-year slumber at V=15.5, the star rose within
2 days to a peak brightness of 8.2, and showed a main eruption lasting 25 days.
The return to quiescence was punctuated by 12 small eruptions, of ~1 mag
amplitude and 2 day recurrence time; these ""echo outbursts"" are of uncertain
origin, but somewhat resemble the normal outbursts of dwarf novae. After 52
days, the star began a slow decline to quiescence.
  Periodic waves in the light curve closely followed the pattern seen in the
1978 superoutburst: a strong orbital signal dominated the first 12 days,
followed by a powerful /common superhump/ at 0.05721(5) d, 0.92(8)% longer than

superhump appeared to follow familiar rules for such phenomena in dwarf novae,
with components given by linear combinations of two basic frequencies: the
orbital frequency omega_o and an unseen low frequency Omega, believed to
represent the accretion disk's apsidal precession. Long time series reveal an
intricate fine structure, with ~20 incommensurate frequencies. Essentially all
components occurred at a frequency n(omega_o)-m(Omega), with m=1, ..., n. But

prescription of the earlier case, we find a recipe that fits accurately the

allowed us to derive accurate light curves, and in turn mean magnitudes and
colors for a sample of 53 RR Lyrae. To overcome the thorny problem of
differential reddening affecting this cluster, we derived new empirical
relations connecting the intrinsic (B-V) and (V-I) colors of fundamental

they rely on stellar parameters which are not affected by reddening; ii) they
supply accurate estimates of intrinsic colors across the fundamental
instability strip and cover a wide metallicity range; iii) they were derived by
neglecting the RR Lyrae that are affected by amplitude modulation. Moreover,
the zero-point of the E(B-V) reddening scale was empirically checked using the
large sample of RR Lyrae in M3 (Corwin & Carney 2001), a GGC affected by a
vanishing reddening. According to these relations we estimated individual
reddenings for RR Lyrae in our sample and the main results we found are the

<E(B-V)>=0.30\pm0.03. iii) According to current individual E(B-V) and E(V-I)

year interval from 1994 to 1999, and allow us to firmly establish the pulsation
mode and periodicity of the variable. The derived period P=0.361699 days (+/-
0.000001) is very close to the value published in the Fourth Edition of the
General Catalogue of Variable Stars (P=0.361732 days). However, contrary to
what was previously found, the amplitude and shape of the light curve qualify
CM Leo as a very regular first overtone pulsator with a prominent hump on the
rising branch of its multicolour light curves. According to an abundace
analysis performed on three spectra taken near minimum light (0.42 < phase <
0.61), CM Leo is a metal-poor star with metal abundance [Fe/H]=-1.93 +/- 0.20.
The photometric and radial velocity curves of CM Leo have been compared with
the predictions of suitable pulsational models to infer tight constraints on
the stellar mass, effective temperature, and distance modulus of the star. We
derive a true distance modulus of CM Leo of (m-M)0=13.11 +/- 0.02 mag and a
corresponding absolute magnitude of Mv=0.47 +/- 0.04. This absolute magnitude,

phenomenon in which deterministic and scaling components are superimposed. Our
approach is based on the wavelet multiresolution analysis combined with the
scaling analysis of the entropy of a time series. The wavelet multiresolution
analysis decomposes the signal in a {\it scale-by-scale} manner. The {\it
scale-by-scale} decomposition generates smooth and detail curves which are
evaluated and studied. A wavelet-based smoothing filtering is used to estimate
the daily birth rate and conception rate during the year. The scaling analysis
is based upon the Diffusion Entropy Analysis (DEA). The joint use of the DEA
and the wavelet multiresolution analysis allows: 1) the separation of the
deterministic and, therefore, non-scaling component from the scaling component
of the signal; 2) the determination of the stochastic information

Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). Using phase-coherent timing, we find a wide
variety of behaviors among the sources, ranging from high stability (in 1E
2259.1+586 in quiescence and 4U 0142+61), to instabilities so severe that
phase-coherent timing is not possible (in 1E 1048.1-5937). We note a
correlation in which timing stability in AXPs decreases with increasing
$\dot{\nu}$. The timing stability of soft gamma repeaters (SGRs) in quiescence
is consistent with this trend, which is similar to one seen in radio pulsars.
We find no significant pulse morphology variations in any AXP in quiescence. We
considered high signal-to-noise average pulse profiles for each AXP as a
function of energy. We show that, as in the timing properties, there is a
variety of different behaviors for the energy dependence. We also used the
monitoring and archival data to obtain pulsed flux time series for each source.
We have found no large changes in pulsed flux for any source in quiescence, and
have set $1\sigma$ upper limits on variations ~20-30% depending on the source.

series, are only valid for random fluctuations that are stationary in time.
Unfortunately, these data are often non stationary and the use of techniques of
analysis resting on the stationary assumption can produce a wrong information

test and compare two techniques for removing the non-stationary influences from
computer generated time series, consisting of the superposition of a slow
signal and a random fluctuation. The former is based on the method of wavelet
decomposition, and the latter is a proposal of this paper, denoted by us as
step detrending technique. We focus our attention on two cases, when the slow
signal is a periodic function mimicking the influence of seasons, and when it
is an aperiodic signal mimicking the influence of a population change (increase
or decrease). For the purpose of computational simplicity the random
fluctuation is taken to be uncorrelated. However, the detrending techniques
here illustrated work also in the case when the random component is correlated.
This expectation is fully confirmed by the sociological applications made in
the companion paper. We also illustrate a new procedure to assess the existence
of a genuine scaling, based on the adoption of diffusion entropy, multiscaling
analysis and the direct assessment of scaling. Using artificial sequences, we
show that the joint use of all these techniques yield the detection of the real

of OB-type stars is variable on various scales both in time and velocity. For
spectral types from O3 to B1, 64% vary in time. At spectral types later than

of km/s of the wind profile and can be strong. The width over which the wind O
VI profile varies is only weakly correlated with the terminal velocity (\vinf),

the maximum velocity of the variation and \vinf. High velocity O VI wind
absorption features (possibly related to the discrete absorption components

These features are variable, but the nature of their\npropagation cannot be determined from this survey. If X-rays can produce\nsufficient O VI by Auger ionization of O VI, and the X-rays originate from\nstrong shocks in the wind, this study suggests that stronger shocks occur more\nfrequently near \\vinf, causing an enhancement of O VI near \\vinf.'}","[{'name': 'N.

Current data cover an area of about 0.3 square degrees around the center of the
galaxy and allowed us to identify 92 variables. Among them 75 are RR Lyrae
stars, 15 are ""bona fide"" Anomalous Cepheids, one might be a Galactic field RR
Lyrae, and one is located along the Carina Red Giant Branch. Expanding upon the
seminal photographic investigation by Saha, Monet & Seitzer (1986) we supply
for the first time accurate estimates of their pulsation parameters (periods,
amplitudes, mean magnitude and colors) on the basis of CCD photometry.
Approximately 50% of both RR Lyrae and Anomalous Cepheids are new
identifications. Among the RR Lyrae sample 6 objects are new candidate
double-mode variables. On the basis of their pulsation properties we estimated
that two variables (V152, V182) are about 50% more massive than typical RR
Lyrae stars, while the bulk of the Anomalous Cepheids are roughly a factor of
two more massive than fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars. This finding supports
the evidence that these objects are intermediate-mass stars during central He
burning phases. The data for Carina, together with data available in the
literature, strongly support the conclusion that dSph galaxies can barely be
classified into the classical Oosterhoff dichotomy. The mean period of
fundamental mode RR Lyrae in Carina resembles that found for Oosterhoff type II
clusters, whereas the ratio between first overtones and total number of RR

Expanding upon the\nseminal photographic investigation by Saha, Monet & Seitzer (1986) we supply\nfor the first time accurate estimates of their pulsation parameters (periods,\namplitudes, mean magnitude and colors) on the basis of CCD photometry.\nApproximately 50% of both RR Lyrae and Anomalous Cepheids are new\nidentifications. Among the RR Lyrae sample 6 objects are new candidate\ndouble-mode variables. On the basis of their pulsation properties we estimated\nthat two variables (V152, V182) are about 50% more massive than typical RR\nLyrae stars, while the bulk of the Anomalous Cepheids are roughly a factor of\ntwo more massive than fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars. This finding supports\nthe evidence that these objects are intermediate-mass stars during central He\nburning phases. The data for Carina, together with data available in the\nliterature, strongly support the conclusion that dSph galaxies can barely be\nclassified into the classical Oosterhoff dichotomy. The mean period of\nfundamental mode RR Lyrae in Carina resembles that found for Oosterhoff type II\nclusters, whereas the ratio between first overtones and total number of RR\nLyrae is quite similar to that found in Oosterhoff type I clusters.'}","[{'name': ""M.

6316. Our color-magnitude diagrams show a predominantly red-clump horizontal
branch morphology with no evidence of the blue extensions seen in NGC 6388 and
NGC 6441. Our data are in good agreement with published estimates of the
reddening and metallicity provided the cluster has an absolute distance modulus
of 15.50 mag. We have discovered more than one dozen long-period variable stars
in our field of view, and argue that at least seven of them are members of NGC
6316. We have also discovered four RR Lyrae variables, although only one of
them probably belongs to the cluster. The specific frequency of RR Lyrae stars
in NGC 6316 is found to be less than 0.4, making it clear that this cluster is
a normal, metal-rich globular and is not an analog of NGC 6388 and NGC 6441. We

radiochemical solar neutrino data have shown evidence of the effects of solar
rotation and also indications of oscillations with two periods that are well

and another at about 52 days period. We here analyze both data sets, taken
together, to test the hypothesis that the above periodicities, and a related
periodicity with a period of about 77 days, are due to r-mode oscillations with
spherical harmonic indices l = 3 and m = 1, 2, and 3. These would have
frequencies nuR/6, nuR/3, and nuR/2, where nuR is the sidereal rotation rate

information from power spectra formed from Homestake and GALLEX-GNO data. From
this statistic, we form another statistic to search for a sidereal rotation
frequency that leads simultaneously to four peaks in the Homestake-GALLEX-GNO
spectrum: one corresponding to the synodic rotation frequency nuR - 1, and the
other three corresponding to the l = 3 r-modes. We find that, in the range 0 to
20 cycles per year, there is one notable peak at 13.88 cycles per year; This
falls in the rotation frequency range of the radiative zone. The corresponding
synodic rotation period is 28.4 days, and the corresponding r-mode periods are

many practical applications. From theoretical point of view, the key interest
is in a proper description of the structure and dynamics of correlations. From
practical point of view, the emphasis is on the ability of the developed models
to provide the adequate input for the numerous portfolio and risk management
procedures used in the financial industry. This is crucial, since it has been
long argued that correlation matrices determined from financial series contain
a relatively large amount of noise and, in addition, most of the portfolio and
risk management techniques used in practice can be quite sensitive to the
inputs. In this paper we introduce a model (simulation)-based approach which
can be used for a systematic investigation of the effect of the different
sources of noise in financial correlations in the portfolio and risk management
context. To illustrate the usefulness of this framework, we develop several toy
models for the structure of correlations and, by considering the finiteness of
the time series as the only source of noise, we compare the performance of
several correlation matrix estimators introduced in the academic literature and
which have since gained also a wide practical use. Based on this experience, we
believe that our simulation-based approach can also be useful for the
systematic investigation of several other problems of much interest in finance.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=0&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Financial correlations play a central role in financial theory and also in\nmany practical applications.

with stretched exponential (SE) distributions) to characterize the
distributions of empirical returns of financial time series, with application
to the 100 years of daily return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and over 1
years of 5-minutes returns of the Nasdaq Composite index. Based on the
discovery that the SE distribution tends to the Pareto distribution in a
certain limit such that the Pareto (or power law) distribution can be
approximated with any desired accuracy on an arbitrary interval by a suitable
adjustment of the parameters of the SE distribution, we demonstrate that Wilks'
test of nested hypothesis still works for the non-exactly nested comparison
between the SE and Pareto distributions. The SE distribution is found
significantly better over the whole quantile range but becomes unnecessary
beyond the 95% quantiles compared with the Pareto law. Similar conclusions hold
for the log-Weibull model with respect to the Pareto distribution. Our main
result is that the tails ultimately decay slower than any stretched exponential
distribution but probably faster than power laws with reasonable exponents.

estimation and management are presented.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=0&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""A large consensus now seems to take for granted that the distributions of\nempirical returns of financial time series are regularly varying, with a tail\nexponent close to 3.

identifications of X-ray sources in 47 Tuc reported in Paper I. The eight CVs
with secure orbital periods have fainter accretion disks, in the V band, than
field CVs with similar periods. These faint disks and the faint absolute
magnitudes (Mv) of the 47 Tuc CVs suggests they have low accretion rates. The
median Fx/Fopt value for the 47 Tuc CVs is higher than that of all known
classes of field CV, because of both the faint Mv values and the relatively
high X-ray luminosities (Lx). The latter are only seen in DQ Her systems in the
field, but the 47 Tuc CVs are much fainter optically than most field DQ Hers.
Some combination of magnetic behavior and low accretion rates may be able to
explain our observations, but the results at present are ambiguous, since no
class of field CV has distributions of both Lx and Mv that are consistent with
those of the 47 Tuc CVs. The radial distribution of the X-ray detected active
binaries is indistinguishable from that of the much larger sample of optical
variables detected in previous WFPC2 studies. The X-ray properties of these
objects are consistent with those of active binaries found in field studies.
One reasonable and one marginal candidate for optical identification of a
quiescent LMXB was found (one is already known). Finally, we study the blue
variables showing little or no evidence for X-ray emission. Their generally
long periods and the absence of flickering suggests they are not CVs. At

series: one may, for instance, wish to estimate what the power spectrum of the
combined data sets might have been, or one may wish to estimate the
significance of a particular peak that shows up in two or more power spectra.
Also, one may occasionally need to search for a complex of peaks in a single
power spectrum, such as a fundamental and one or more harmonics, or a
fundamental plus sidebands, etc. Visual inspection can be revealing, but it can
also be misleading. This leads one to look for one or more ways of forming
statistics, which readily lend themselves to significance estimation, from two
or more power spectra. The familiar chi-square statistic provides a convenient
mechanism for combining variables drawn from normal distributions, and one may
generalize the chi-square statistic to be any function of any number of
variables with arbitrary distributions. In dealing with power spectra, we are
interested mainly in exponential distributions. One well-known statistic,
formed from the sum of two or more variables with exponential distributions,
satisfies the gamma distribution. We show that a transformation of this
statistic has the convenient property that it has an exponential distribution.
We introduce two additional statistics formed from two or more variables with
exponential distributions. For certain investigations, we may wish to study the
minimum power (as a function of frequency) drawn from two or more power

structural parameter of the logistic map along with the initial value $x_1$

proposed techniques on simulated numerical examples give favorable results (at
least, for the investigated combinations of sample size $N$ and noise level).
Besides, unlike some suggested techniques, our method does not require the a

inherent difficulties in the statistical analysis of deterministically chaotic
time series and the status of previously proposed Bayesian approaches. We note
the trade-off between the need of using a large number of data points in the ML
analysis to decrease the bias (to guarantee consistency of the estimation) and
the unstable nature of dynamical trajectories with exponentially fast loss of
memory of the initial condition. The method of statistical moments for the

Comparisons with previously\nproposed techniques on simulated numerical examples give favorable results (at\nleast, for the investigated combinations of sample size $N$ and noise level).\nBesides, unlike some suggested techniques, our method does not require the a\npriori knowledge of the noise variance. We also clarify the nature of the\ninherent difficulties in the statistical analysis of deterministically chaotic\ntime series and the status of previously proposed Bayesian approaches. We note\nthe trade-off between the need of using a large number of data points in the ML\nanalysis to decrease the bias (to guarantee consistency of the estimation) and\nthe unstable nature of dynamical trajectories with exponentially fast loss of\nmemory of the initial condition. The method of statistical moments for the\nestimation of the parameter of the logistic map is discussed. This method seems\nto be the unique method whose consistency for deterministically chaotic time\nseries is proved so far theoretically (not only numerically).""}","[{'name': 'V. F.

semiflexible polymer in a poor solvent via 3-D Brownian Dynamics simulations.
Earlier work indicates that the condensation of semiflexible polymers
generically proceeds via a cascade through metastable racquet-shaped,
long-lived intermediates towards the stable torus state. We investigate the
rate of decay of uncollapsed states, analyze the preferential pathways of
condensation, and describe likelihood and lifespan of the different metastable
states. The simulation are performed with a bead-stiff spring model with
excluded volume interaction and exponentially decaying attractive potential.
The semiflexible chain collapse is studied as functions of the three relevant
length scales of the phenomenon, i.e., the total chain length $L$, the
persistence length $L_p$ and the condensation length $L_0 = \sqrt{k_B T
L_p/u_0}$, where $u_0$ is a measure of the attractive potential per unit
length. Two dimensionless ratios, $L/L_p$ and $L_0/L_p$, suffice to describe
the decay rate of uncollapsed states, which appears to scale as $(L/L_p)^{1/3}
(L_0/L_p)$. The condensation sequence is described in terms of the time series
of the well separated energy levels associated with each metastable collapsed
state. The collapsed states are described quantitatively through the spatial
correlation of tangent vectors along the chain. We also compare the results

oscillations has been debated since their discovery in the 1970s and competing
hypotheses are based on either white dwarf non-radial g-mode pulsations or
magnetically-channelled accretion onto a rotating white dwarf. By analogy with
the ZZ Ceti stars, we argue that the non-radial g-mode pulsation model demands
a strong dependence of pulse period on the white dwarf's temperature. However,
these observations show the 29 s oscillation is independent of the white
dwarf's temperature. Thus we reject the white dwarf non-radial g-mode pulsation
hypothesis as the sole origin of the oscillations. It remains unclear if
magnetically-funnelled accretion onto a rapidly rotating white dwarf (or belt
on the white dwarf) is responsible for producing the oscillations. We also

a constant strain rate tests report an intriguing dynamical crossover from a
low dimensional chaotic state at medium strain rates to an infinite dimensional
power law state of stress drops at high strain rates. We present results of an
extensive study of all aspects of the PLC effect within the context a model
that reproduces this crossover. A study of the distribution of the Lyapunov
exponents as a function of strain rate shows that it changes from a small set
of positive exponents in the chaotic regime to a dense set of null exponents in
the scaling regime. As the latter feature is similar to the GOY shell model for
turbulence, we compare our results with the GOY model. Interestingly, the null
exponents in our model themselves obey a power law. The configuration of
dislocations is visualized through the slow manifold analysis. This shows that
while a large proportion of dislocations are in the pinned state in the chaotic
regime, most of them are at the threshold of unpinning in the scaling regime.
The model qualitatively reproduces the different types of deformation bands
seen in experiments. At high strain rates where propagating bands are seen, the
model equations are reduced to the Fisher-Kolmogorov equation for propagative
fronts. This shows that the velocity of the bands varies linearly with the
strain rate and inversely with the dislocation density, consistent with the

determine the general form of time sequences for the constant magnitude

due to alias problems in the data set (caused by single-site observations). The
extent to which the aliasing affected their analysis was unclear due to the
unknown damping time of the stellar oscillation modes. In this paper we
describe a simulator created to generate time series of stochastically excited
oscillations, which takes as input an arbitrary window function and includes
both white and non-white noise. We also outline a new method to compare a large
number of simulated time series with an observed time series to determine the
damping time, amplitude, and limited information on the degree of the
stochastically excited modes. For xi Hya we find the most likely amplitude to
be ~ 2 m/s, in good agreement with theory (Houdek & Gough, 2002), and the most

variable pre-main sequence (PMS) stars in the young (2-4 Myr) open cluster NGC
2664, based on photometric monitoring using the Wide Field Imager (WFI) on the
2.2m telescope on La Silla (Chile). In total, about 10600 stars with I_c
magnitudes between 9.8mag and 21mag have been monitored in our 34x33 arcmin
field. Time series data were obtained in the I_c band in 44 nights between Dec.
2000 and March 2001; altogether we obtained 88 data points per star. Using two
different time series analysis techniques (Scargle and CLEAN) we found 543
periodically variable stars with periods between 0.2 days and 15 days. Also,
484 irregular variable stars were identified using a chi-squared-test. In
addition we have carried out nearly simultaneous observations in V, R_c and a
narrow-band Halpha filter. The photometric data enable us to reject background
and foreground stars from our sample of variable stars according to their
location in the I_c vs. (R_c-I_c) colour-magnitude and (R_c-Halpha) vs.

variable and 184 irregular variable PMS stars as cluster members using these
two different tests. In addition 35 PMS stars for which no significant

novel approach. The variability in the UV and optical bands can also be
modelled as a result of aperiodic variability (red noise) in the system. There
is evidence that the UV and X-ray fluxes are anti-correlated with a time delay
of about 100 s, with the UV lagging behind the X-ray emission. This
anti-correlation is intriguing, but is only present on two occasions lasting
several 1000 s each. The X-ray spectrum shows similar emission features to
other dwarf novae and is well fitted using a multi-temperature emission model.
We measure a relatively high X-ray luminosity of ~1.4x10^{32} ergs/s, although
this is consistent with a low binary inclination. Finally, we find evidence for
a possible -1200km/s blue shift in the fitted Fe K line energies, possibly
indicating the presence of an outflow in this low inclination system.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=0&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We present results from the XMM observations of the dwarf nova YZ Cnc in a\nquiescent state.

of an RR Lyrae model consistently and automatically along its evolutionary
track throughout the whole instability strip. It is based on the powerful
amplitude equation formalism, and resorts to a judicious combination of
numerical hydrodynamical simulations, the analytical signal time-series
analysis, and amplitude equations. A large-scale survey of the nonlinear
pulsations in RR Lyr instability strip is then presented, and the mode
selection mechanism is delineated throughout the relevant regions of parameter
space. We obtain and examine two regions with hysteresis, where the pulsational
state depends on the direction of the evolutionary tracks, namely a region with
either fundamental (RRab) or first overtone (RRc) pulsations and a region with
either fundamental (RRab) or double-mode (RRd) pulsations. The regions where
stable double-mode (DM, or RRd) pulsations occur are very narrow and hard to
find in astrophysical parameter (L, M, T_eff, X, Z) space with hydrodynamic
simulations, but our systematic and efficient methodology allows us to
investigate them with unprecedented detail. It is shown that by simultaneously
considering the effects of mode selection and of horizontal branch evolution we
can naturally solve one of the extant puzzles involving the topologies of the
theoretical and observed instability strips, namely the slope of the
fundamental blue edge. The importance of the interplay between mode selection
and stellar evolutionary effects is also demonstrated for the properties of
double-mode RR Lyr. Finally, the Petersen diagram of double-mode RR Lyr models
is discussed for the first time.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=0&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We describe a methodology that allows us to follow the pulsational behavior\nof an RR Lyrae model consistently and automatically along its evolutionary\ntrack throughout the whole instability strip.

Power laws and scale
invariance of fluctuations are often taken as the hallmarks of complexity,
drawing on analogies with equilibrium critical phenomena[1-3]. Here we argue
that slow, directed dynamics, during which the system's properties change
significantly, is fundamental. The underlying dynamics is related to a slow,
decelerating but spasmodic release of an intrinsic strain or tension. Time
series of a number of appropriate observables can be analysed to confirm this
effect. The strain arises from local frustration. As the strain is released
through ""quakes"", some system variable undergoes record statistics with

require extensive mining and refining to extract useful information. We
demonstrate the usefulness of (nonmetric) multidimensional scaling (MDS) method
in analyzing a large number of genes. Applying MDS to the microarray data is
certainly not new, but the existing works are all on small numbers
  (< 100) of points to be analyzed. We have been developing an efficient novel
algorithm for nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) analysis for very large
data sets as a maximally unsupervised data mining device. We wish to
demonstrate its usefulness in the context of bioinformatics (unraveling
relational patterns among genes from time series data in this paper).
  Results: The Pearson correlation coefficient with its sign flipped is used to
measure the dissimilarity of the gene activities in transcriptional response of
cell-cycle-synchronized human fibroblasts to serum [Iyer {\it et al}., Science
{\bf 283}, 83 (1999)]. These dissimilarity data have been analyzed with our
nMDS algorithm to produce an almost circular relational pattern of the genes.
The obtained pattern expresses a temporal order in the data in this example;
the temporal expression pattern of the genes rotates along this circular
arrangement and is related to the cell cycle. For the data we analyze in this
paper we observe the following. If an appropriate preparation procedure is
applied to the original data set, linear methods such as the principal
component analysis (PCA) could achieve reasonable results, but without data

These dissimilarity data have been analyzed with our\nnMDS algorithm to produce an almost circular relational pattern of the genes.\nThe obtained pattern expresses a temporal order in the data in this example;\nthe temporal expression pattern of the genes rotates along this circular\narrangement and is related to the cell cycle. For the data we analyze in this\npaper we observe the following. If an appropriate preparation procedure is\napplied to the original data set, linear methods such as the principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) could achieve reasonable results, but without data\npreprocessing linear methods such as PCA cannot achieve a useful picture.\nFurthermore, even with an appropriate data preprocessing, the outcomes of\nlinear procedures are not as clearcut as those by nMDS without preprocessing.'}","[{'name': 'Y. -h.

mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), and apply it to XMM-Newton observations of M31. We
examine X-ray time series variability seeking power density spectra (PDS)
typical of LMXBs accreting at a low accretion rate (which we refer to as Type A
PDS); these are very similar for black hole and neutron star LMXBs. Galactic
neutron star LMXBs exhibit Type A PDS at low luminosities (~10^36--10^37 erg/s)
while black hole LMXBs can exhibit them at luminosities >10^38 erg/s. We
propose that Type A PDS are confined to luminosities below a critical fraction
of the Eddington limit, $l_c$ that is constant for all LMXBs; we have examined
asample of black hole and neutron star LMXBs and find they are all consistent
with $l_c$ = 0.10+/-0.04 in the 0.3--10 keV band. We present luminosity and PDS
data from 167 observations of X-ray binaries in M31 that provide strong support
for our hypothesis. Since the theoretical maximum mass for a neutron star is
\~3.1 M_Sun, we therefore assert that any LMXB that exhibits a Type A PDS at a
0.3--10 keV luminosity greater than 4 x 10^37 erg/s is likely to contain a
black hole primary. We have found eleven new black hole candidates in M31 using
this method. We focus on XMM-Newton observations of RX J0042.4+4112, an X-ray
source in M31 and find the mass of the primary to be 7+/-2 M_Sun, if our

\~40 observations made over 23 years, and is likely to be a persistently bright
LMXB; by contrast all known Galactic black hole LMXBs are transient. Hence our

LMXBs and also in LMXBs in other galaxies.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=0&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We present a new technique for identifying stellar mass black holes in low\nmass X-ray binaries (LMXBs), and apply it to XMM-Newton observations of M31.

of a photometric variability study. Our targets in the vicinity of Epsilon Ori
belong to the OriOB1b population in the Orion star-forming complex. In this
region we selected 143 VLM stars and brown dwarfs (BDs), whose photometry in
RIJHK is consistent with membership of the young population. The variability of
these objects was investigated using a densely sampled I-band time series
covering four consecutive nights with altogether 129 data points per object.
Our targets show three types of variability: Thirty objects, including nine
BDs, show significant photometric periods, ranging from 4h up to 100h, which we
interpret as the rotation periods. Five objects, including two BDs, exhibit
variability with high amplitudes up to 1 mag which is at least partly
irregular. This behaviour is most likely caused by ongoing accretion and
confirms that VLM objects undergo a T Tauri phase similar to solar-mass stars.
Finally, one VLM star shows a strong flare event of 0.3 mag amplitude. The
rotation periods show dependence on mass, i.e. the average period decreases
with decreasing object mass, consistent with previously found mass-period
relationships in younger and older clusters. The period distribution of BDs
extends down to the breakup period, where centrifugal and gravitational forces
are balanced. Combining our BD periods with literature data, we found that the
lower period limit for substellar objects lies between 2h and 4h, more or less
independent of age. Contrary to stars, these fast rotating BDs seem to evolve
at constant rotation period from ages of 3 Myr to 1 Gyr, in spite of the

The second period\ncould be a QPO originating from the oscillation of the ionization front (due to\na hot WD) below the inner Lagrange point as predicted by King (1989) or a beat\nfrequency in the system as a result of the magnetic nature of the WD if steady\naccretion has already been re-established.'}","[{'name': 'S.

not another one) is very rarely discussed. We give here a comprehensive set of
possible event definitions starting from a one-dimensional data set such as a
time-series of energy dissipation. Each definition is then applied to a
time-series of energy dissipation issued from simulations of a shell-model of
magnetohydrodynamic turbulence as defined in Giuliani and Carbone (1998), or
from a new model of coupled shell-models designed to represent a magnetic loop
in the solar corona. We obtain distributions of the peak dissipation power,
total energy, duration and waiting-time associated to each definition. These
distributions are then investigated and compared, and the influence of the
definition of an event on statistics is discussed. In particular, power-law
distributions are more likely to appear when using a threshold. The sensitivity
of the distributions to the definition of an event seems also to be weaker for
events found in a highly intermittent time series. Some implications on

analyze archival data from Cyg X-1 during its failed state transition. The

pulsar dispersion measures using the Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope. This
experiment was carried out for a sample of twelve pulsars, over a period of
more than one year (January 2001 to May 2002) with observations about once
every fortnight. At each epoch, the pulsar DMs were obtained from simultaneous
dual frequency observations, without requiring any absolute timing information.
The DM estimates were obtained from both the single pulse data streams and from
the average profiles. The accuracy of the DM estimates at each epoch is ~ 1
part in 10^4 or better, making the data set useful for many different kinds of
studies. The time series of DM shows significant variations on time scales of
weeks to months for most of the pulsars. A comparison of the mean DM values
from these data show significant deviations from catalog values (as well as
from other estimates in literature) for some of the pulsars, with PSR B1642-03
showing the most notable changes. From our analysis results it appears that
constancy of pulsar DMs (at the level of 1 in 10^3 or better) can not be taken
for granted. For PSR B2217+47, we see evidence for a large-scale DM gradient
over a one year period, which is modeled as being due to a blob of enhanced
electron density sampled by the line of sight. For some pulsars, including
pulsars with fairly simple profiles like PSR B1642-03, we find evidence for
small changes in DM values for different frequency pairs of measurement, a
result that needs to be investigated in detail. Another interesting result is
that we find significant differences in DM values obtained from average

years.We als o report reprocessing of an overlapping series of archival Chandra
observations. By including earlier ASCA and SAX observations, we present a new,
nine-year time series of models fit to the X-ray spectrum of NGC4258. Over the
nine years, the photoelectric absorbing column (~10^23 cm^-2) did not vary
detectably, except for a ~40% drop between two ASCA epochs separated by 3 years
and a ~60% rise between two XMM epochs separated by just 5 months. In contrast,
factor of 2-3 changes are seen in absorbed flux on the timescale of years.
These are uncorrelated with changes in absorbing column and indicative of
central engine variability. The most rapid change in luminosity (5-10 keV) that
we detect is ~30% over 19 days. The warped disk, a known source of H2O maser
emission in NGC4258, is believed to cross the line of sight to the central
engine. We propose that the variations in absorbing column arise from
inhomogeneities sweeping across the line of sight in the rotating disk at the
radius where the disk crosses the line of sight. We estimate that the
inhomogeneities are ~10^15 cm in size at the crossing radius of 0.29 pc,
slightly smaller than the expected scale height of the disk. This result thus
provides strong evidence that the warped accretion disk is the absorber. This
is the first direct confirmation that obscuration in type-2 AGN may, in some
cases, arise in thin, warped accretion disks, rather than in geometrically
thick tori. We do not detect Fe Kalpha line emission in any of our XMM spectra.

significantly improve our knowledge of relativistic gravity. The primary
mission objective is to i) measure the key post-Newtonian Eddington parameter
$\gamma$ with accuracy of a part in 10$^9$. $(1-\gamma)$ is a direct measure
for presence of a new interaction in gravitational theory, and, in its search,
LATOR goes a factor 30,000 beyond the present best result, Cassini's 2003 test.
Other mission objectives include: ii) first measurement of gravity's non-linear
effects on light to $\sim$0.01% accuracy; including both the traditional
Eddington $\beta$ parameter and also the spatial metric's 2nd order potential
contribution (never been measured before); iii) direct measurement of the solar
quadrupole moment $J_2$ (currently unavailable) to accuracy of a part in 200 of
its expected size; iv) direct measurement of the ``frame-dragging'' effect on
light by the Sun's rotational gravitomagnetic field to one percent accuracy.
LATOR's primary measurement pushes to unprecedented accuracy the search for
cosmologically relevant scalar-tensor theories of gravity by looking for a
remnant scalar field in today's solar system. The key element of LATOR is a

understanding and modelling of the cell's system. Although a vast number of
models have been developed in order to extract biological knowledge from
complex systems composed of basic elements as proteins, genes and chemical
compounds, a need remains for improving our understanding of dynamical features
of the systems (i.e., temporal-dependence).
  In this article, we analyze the gene expression dynamics (i.e., how the genes
expression fluctuates in time) by using a new constructive approach. This
approach is based on only two fundamental ingredients: symmetry and the Markov
property of dynamics. First, by using experimental data of human and yeast gene
expression time series, we found a symmetry in short-time transition
probability from time $t$ to time $t+1$. We call it self-similarity symmetry
(i.e., surprisingly, the gene expression short-time fluctuations contain a
repeating pattern of smaller and smaller parts that are like the whole, but
different in size). Secondly, the Markov property of dynamics reflects that the
short-time fluctuation governs the full-time behaviour of the system. Here, we
succeed in reconstructing naturally the global behavior of the observed
distribution of gene expression (i.e., scaling-law) and the local behaviour of
the power-law tail of this distribution, by using only these two ingredients:

Although a vast number of\nmodels have been developed in order to extract biological knowledge from\ncomplex systems composed of basic elements as proteins, genes and chemical\ncompounds, a need remains for improving our understanding of dynamical features\nof the systems (i.e., temporal-dependence).\n  In this article, we analyze the gene expression dynamics (i.e., how the genes\nexpression fluctuates in time) by using a new constructive approach. This\napproach is based on only two fundamental ingredients: symmetry and the Markov\nproperty of dynamics. First, by using experimental data of human and yeast gene\nexpression time series, we found a symmetry in short-time transition\nprobability from time $t$ to time $t+1$. We call it self-similarity symmetry\n(i.e., surprisingly, the gene expression short-time fluctuations contain a\nrepeating pattern of smaller and smaller parts that are like the whole, but\ndifferent in size). Secondly, the Markov property of dynamics reflects that the\nshort-time fluctuation governs the full-time behaviour of the system. Here, we\nsucceed in reconstructing naturally the global behavior of the observed\ndistribution of gene expression (i.e., scaling-law) and the local behaviour of\nthe power-law tail of this distribution, by using only these two ingredients:\nsymmetry and the Markov property of dynamics.

the immediate neighborhood of the homoclinic curve, nonlinearity can produce
expansion leading to chaos when combined with the recurrence induced by the

sensitivity to noise, so that when the noiseless approach contains a rich

Using Taylor's frozen field hypothesis, we investigate the statistical

find that the probability density functions of exit distances at different
velocity thresholds can be approximated by stretched exponentials with
exponents varying with the velocity thresholds below a critical threshold. We

characterize the dependence of these distributions on the velocity thresholds.
By applying a box-counting multifractal analysis of the natural measure
constructed on the time series of exit distances, we demonstrate the existence
of a genuine multifractality, endowed in addition with negative dimensions.
Performing the same analysis of reshuffled time series with otherwise identical

2001. The analysis reveals that the object was in the decline from an outburst
in 1992 and again in outburst in 2001. The historical light curve collected by
amateur astronomers shows low amplitude (1-2 mag) outbursts 5-10 days long,
recurrent every 80-90 days, confirming its dwarf nova nature. We derive an
outburst decline time scale of 1.2 days mag$^{-1}$. Eclipse mapping techniques
were applied to data both in quiescence and in outburst to derive accretion
disc surface brightness maps. A distance of $d = 170 \pm 30$ pc is obtained
from a method similar to that used to constrain the distance to open clusters.
  From this distance, disc radial brightness temperature distributions are
determined. The temperatures in the quiescent disc vary from $6 000$ K in the
inner regions to $3 000$ K near the outer disc and are flatter than the $T
\propto r^{-{3/4}}$ law for optically thick steady-state disc. The outburst
occurs mainly with a significant increase in brightness of the intermediate and
outer disc regions. The disc temperatures remain below the critical effective
temperature $T_{\rm crit}$ at all disc radii during outburst. The radial
temperature distributions in quiescence and in outburst are significantly
different from those of other dwarf novae of similar orbital period. These
results cannot be explained within the framework of the disc instability model.

applied to calculate the distribution or probability density function in the

standard deviation in the number of agents making a particular choice (e.g.,
the bar attendance) can be calculated in the efficient phase as a function of
the parameter m specifying the agent's memory size. Since situations with tied
cumulative performance of the strategies often occur in the efficient phase and
they are critical in the decision making dynamics, the present theory is
developed to take into account the effects of tied strategies. The analytic
results are found to be in better agreement with numerical results, when
compared with the simplest forms of the crowd-anticrowd theory in which cases
of tied strategies are ignored. Hence the present theory represents a
generalization of the crowd-anticrowd theory of multi-agent models, by focusing
on the evolution of strategy ranking patterns instead of the performance of

observed GWBs are inherently time-dependent due to the non-stationarity of the
gravitational-wave detector. Since the cross-correlated signal is obtained
through an all-sky integral of primary signals convolving with the antenna
pattern function of gravitational-wave detectors, the non-stationarity of
cross-correlated signals, together with full knowledge of antenna pattern

perturbative expansion in low-frequency regime. The first one is based on
harmonic-Fourier representation of data streams and the second is based on

confirm outstanding diversity of pulsational behaviour of different lines in

extreme vertical chemical inhomogeneity of the HR 3831 atmosphere and a running

increasing amplitude. Rapid profile variation of the NdIII 6145 A line is

distortion of pulsations in HR 3831 by the global magnetic field. We interpret

across all colors with the majority of variables having amplitudes of 0.15

Lacertae. 750 hours of high-quality differential photoelectric Stromgren,
Johnson and Geneva time-series photometry were obtained with 9 telescopes
during 190 nights. Our frequency analysis results in the detection of 23
sinusoidal signals in the light curves. Eleven of those correspond to
independent pulsation modes, and the remainder are combination frequencies. We
find some slow aperiodic variability such as that seemingly present in several
Beta Cephei stars. We perform mode identification from our colour photometry,
derive the spherical degree l for the five strongest modes unambiguously and
provide constraints on l for the weaker modes. We find a mixture of modes of 0
<= l <= 4. In particular, we prove that the previously suspected rotationally
split triplet within the modes of 12 Lac consists of modes of different l;
their equal frequency splitting must thus be accidental.
  One of the periodic signals we detected in the light curves is argued to be a
linearly stable mode excited to visible amplitude by nonlinear mode coupling
via a 2:1 resonance. We also find a low-frequency signal in the light
variations whose physical nature is unclear; it could be a parent or daughter
mode resonantly coupled. The remaining combination frequencies are consistent
with simple light-curve distortions.
  The range of excited pulsation frequencies of 12 Lac may be sufficiently
large that it cannot be reproduced by standard models. We suspect that the star

capable of explaining the presence of Beta Cephei stars in the LMC.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=0&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We report a multisite photometric campaign for the Beta Cephei star 12\nLacertae. 750 hours of high-quality differential photoelectric Stromgren,\nJohnson and Geneva time-series photometry were obtained with 9 telescopes\nduring 190 nights.

variability in young brown dwarfs. High-resolution optical spectra of six

2005 January-March on the Magellan 6.5m telescope. We find significant
variability in Halpha and a number of other emission lines related to accretion
and outflow processes on a variety of timescales ranging from hours to weeks to
years. The most dramatic changes are seen for 2M1207, 2M1101 and ChaI-ISO217.
We observe possible accretion rate changes by about an order of magnitude in
two of these objects, over timescales of weeks (2M1207) or hours (2M1101). The
accretion 'burst' seen in 2M1101 could be due to a 'clumpy' flow. We also see
indications for changes in the outflow rate in at least three objects. In one
case (ISO217), there appears to be a ~1-hour time lag between outflow and
accretion variations, consistent with a scenario in which the wind originates
from the inner disk edge. Our variability study supports a close to edge-on
inclination for the brown dwarf LS-RCrA 1. The fact that all targets in our
sample show variations in accretion and/or outflow indicators suggests that
studies of young brown dwarf properties should be based either on large samples

asteroseismology (where `mode' is to be understood in an astronomical rather
than in a statistical sense), which uses a time series of the first 3 moments
of a spectral line to estimate the discrete oscillation mode parameters l and
m. The method, contrary to many other mode identification techniques, also
provides estimates of other important continuous parameters such as the
inclination angle alpha, and the rotational velocity v_e. We developed a
statistical formalism for the moment method based on so-called generalized
estimating equations (GEE). This formalism allows the estimation of the
uncertainty of the continuous parameters taking into account that the different
moments of a line profile are correlated and that the uncertainty of the
observed moments also depends on the model parameters. Furthermore, we set up a
procedure to take into account the mode uncertainty, i.e., the fact that often
several modes (l,m) can adequately describe the data. We also introduce a new
lack of fit function which works at least as well as a previous discriminant
function, and which in addition allows us to identify the sign of the azimuthal
order m. We applied our method to the star HD181558, using several numerical
methods, from which we learned that numerically solving the estimating

The method, contrary to many other mode identification techniques, also\nprovides estimates of other important continuous parameters such as the\ninclination angle alpha, and the rotational velocity v_e.

Furthermore, we set up a\nprocedure to take into account the mode uncertainty, i.e., the fact that often\nseveral modes (l,m) can adequately describe the data. We also introduce a new\nlack of fit function which works at least as well as a previous discriminant\nfunction, and which in addition allows us to identify the sign of the azimuthal\norder m.

spherical harmonic components and find it is dominated by the l=1 pulsation,

phase with the two minima of the radio integrated pulse profile but are phase
aligned with the peaks of the X-ray profile. Historically, individual pulses

By\nanalyzing the statistics of the returns, we present quantitatively the\ndeterministic and random influences on financial time series for both markets,\nfor which we can give a simple physical interpretation. We particularly focus\non the diffusion coefficient that may be significantly important for the\ncreation of a portfolio.'}","[{'name': 'Gyuchang Lim'}, {'name': 'Soo Yong Kim'}, {'name': 'Junyuan Zhou'}, {'name': 'Seong-Min Yoon'}, {'name': 'Kyungsik Kim'}]",{'name': 'Kyungsik Kim'},Kyungsik Kim,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0512216v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0512216v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'q-fin.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]","5 pages, 9 figures",
