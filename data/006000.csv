representation of a dynamical system. Here we explore in some detail the

consider the degree sequence of horizontal visibility graphs generated by the

by making a time-delay reconstruction to unfold the dynamics on a
multi-dimensional state space. An important aspect of the analysis is the
choice of the correct embedding dimension. The conventional procedure used for
this is either the method of false nearest neighbors or the saturation of some
invariant measure, such as, correlation dimension. Here we examine this issue
from a complex network perspective and propose a recurrence network based
measure to determine the acceptable minimum embedding dimension to be used for
such analysis. The measure proposed here is based on the well known
Kullback-Leibler divergence commonly used in information theory. We show that

modeling. Benefit from the recent advances in computation power and software
development, millions of models built upon multiple regressions, time series
analysis, random forest and boosting tree were executed in parallel. The models
with smaller validation errors were selected to form the ensemble model. To
better capture the distinct characteristics, forecasting models were
implemented at lead time and lines of business level. The moving windows
validation process automatically selected the models which closely represent
current market condition. The weekly cadence forecasting schema allowed the
model to response effectively to market fluctuation. Generic variable
importance analysis was also developed to increase the model interpretability.
Rather than assuming fixed distribution, this non-parametric permutation
variable importance analysis provided a general framework across methods to
evaluate the variable importance. This variable importance framework can
further extend to classification problem by modifying the mean absolute

Benefit from the recent advances in computation power and software\ndevelopment, millions of models built upon multiple regressions, time series\nanalysis, random forest and boosting tree were executed in parallel. The models\nwith smaller validation errors were selected to form the ensemble model. To\nbetter capture the distinct characteristics, forecasting models were\nimplemented at lead time and lines of business level. The moving windows\nvalidation process automatically selected the models which closely represent\ncurrent market condition. The weekly cadence forecasting schema allowed the\nmodel to response effectively to market fluctuation. Generic variable\nimportance analysis was also developed to increase the model interpretability.\nRather than assuming fixed distribution, this non-parametric permutation\nvariable importance analysis provided a general framework across methods to\nevaluate the variable importance. This variable importance framework can\nfurther extend to classification problem by modifying the mean absolute\npercentage error(MAPE) into misclassify error.

These test functions of temporal lags summarize the\nproperties of separability or symmetry for the given spatial pairs. We use\nfunctional boxplots to visualize the functional median and the variability of\nthe test functions, where the extent of departure from zero at all temporal\nlags indicates the degree of non-separability or asymmetry. We also develop a\nrank-based nonparametric testing procedure for assessing the significance of\nthe non-separability or asymmetry. The performances of the proposed methods are\nexamined by simulations with various commonly used spatio-temporal covariance\nmodels.

cycles is determined by the stellar rotation rate. It is observed that the

0.5-6 years covering rotation periods between 1-40 days. Given our sample size

rotation rate, slightly increasing for longer rotation period. We further show
that the shape of the variability deviates from a pure sine curve, consistent
with observations of the solar cycle. Our measurements do not support the
existence of distinct sequences in the P_rot-P_cyc plane, although there is

investigation. Extremal records summarize the limits of the space explored by a
process, and the historical progression of a record sheds light on the
underlying dynamics of the process. Existing analyses of prediction,
statistical properties, and ultimate limits of record progressions have focused
on particular domains. However, a broad perspective on how record progressions
vary across different spheres of activity needs further development. Here we
employ cross-cutting metrics to compare records across a variety of domains,
including sports, games, biological evolution, and technological development.
We find that these domains exhibit characteristic statistical signatures in
terms of rates of improvement, ""burstiness"" of record-breaking time series, and
the acceleration of the record breaking process. Specifically, sports and games
exhibit the slowest rate of improvement and a wide range of rates of
""burstiness."" Technology improves at a much faster rate and, unlike other
domains, tends to show acceleration in records. Many biological and
technological processes are characterized by constant rates of improvement,
showing less burstiness than sports and games. It is important to understand
how these statistical properties of record progression emerge from the
underlying dynamics. Towards this end, we conduct a detailed analysis of a
particular record-setting event: elite marathon running. In this domain, we
find that studying record-setting data alone can obscure many of the structural
properties of the underlying process. The marathon study also illustrates how
some of the standard statistical assumptions underlying record progression
models may be inappropriate or commonly violated in real-world datasets.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=6000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'World record setting has long attracted public interest and scientific\ninvestigation.

the help of a magnetic Doppler imaging inversion code based on detailed
polarised radiative transfer modelling of the line profiles. Our magnetic
Doppler inversions reveal that the field structure of HR5624 is considerably
simpler and the field strength is much lower than proposed by previous studies.

kG. Our model implies that overall large-scale field topology of HR5624 is
better described as a distorted, asymmetric dipole. The chemical abundance maps
of Mg, Si, Ti, Cr, Fe, and Nd obtained in our study are characterised by
large-scale, high-contrast abundance patterns. These structures correlate
weakly with the magnetic field geometry and show no distinct element
concentrations in the horizontal field regions predicted by theoretical atomic
diffusion calculations. We conclude that the surface magnetic field topology of
HR5624 is not as unusual as previously proposed. Considering these results

temporal resolution, as well as higher flux sensitivity, observations than
employed in previous studies, we analyzed high-cadence time series of
line-of-sight magnetograms of 43 ARs characterized by different flare activity,
which were observed with SDO/HMI from May 2010 to December 2013. On these data,
we estimated four parameters, the generalized fractal dimensions $D_0$ and
$D_8$, and the multifractal parameters $C_{\mathrm{div}}$ and
$D_{\mathrm{div}}$. We found distinct average values of the parameters measured
on ARs that have hosted flares of different class. However, the dispersion of
values measured on ARs that have produced same class events is such that the
parameters deduced from distinct classes of flaring regions can also largely
overlap. Based on the results of our measurements, C- and M-class flaring ARs
are practically indistinguishable, as well as M- and X-class flaring ARs. We
found consistent changes on the time series of the measured parameters only on
$\approx$ 50\% of the studied ARs and $\approx$ 50\% of the M- and X-class

functions in Epilepsy patients should be carefully determined prior to surgery.
Electrocorticography (ECoG)-based Real Time Functional Mapping (RTFM) has been
shown to be a safer alternative to the electrical cortical stimulation mapping
(ESM), which is currently the clinical/gold standard. Conventional methods for
analyzing RTFM signals are based on statistical comparison of signal power at
certain frequency bands. Compared to gold standard (ESM), they have limited
accuracies when assessing channel responses.
  In this study, we address the accuracy limitation of the current RTFM signal
estimation methods by analyzing the full frequency spectrum of the signal and
replacing signal power estimation methods with machine learning algorithms,
specifically random forest (RF), as a proof of concept. We train RF with power
spectral density of the time-series RTFM signal in supervised learning
framework where ground truth labels are obtained from the ESM. Results obtained
from RTFM of six adult patients in a strictly controlled experimental setup
reveal the state of the art detection accuracy of $\approx 78\%$ for the
language comprehension task, an improvement of $23\%$ over the conventional
RTFM estimation method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
exploring the use of machine learning approaches for determining RTFM signal
characteristics, and using the whole-frequency band for better region

correlations need to be taken into account to allow for valid inference.
Otherwise, the variability in the parameter estimates might be under-estimated
resulting in increased false-positive rates. Serial correlations in fMRI data
are commonly characterized in terms of a first-order autoregressive (AR)
process and then removed via pre-whitening. The required noise model for the
pre-whitening depends on a number of parameters, particularly the repetition
time (TR). Here we investigate how the sub-second temporal resolution provided
by simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging changes the noise structure in fMRI
time series. We fit a higher-order AR model and then estimate the optimal AR
model order for a sequence with a TR of less than 600 ms providing whole brain
coverage. We show that physiological noise modelling successfully reduces the
required AR model order, but remaining serial correlations necessitate an
advanced noise model. We conclude that commonly used noise models, such as the
AR(1) model, are inadequate for modelling serial correlations in fMRI using
sub-second TRs. Rather, physiological noise modelling in combination with
advanced pre-whitening schemes enable valid inference in single-subject
analysis using fast fMRI sequences.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=6000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'When performing statistical analysis of single-subject fMRI data, serial\ncorrelations need to be taken into account to allow for valid inference.\nOtherwise, the variability in the parameter estimates might be under-estimated\nresulting in increased false-positive rates.

usually only able to describe a single pathogen. This makes their application
unrealistic in cases where multiple pathogens with similar symptoms are
spreading concurrently within the same population. Here we describe a method
which makes possible the application of multiple single-strain models under
minimal conditions. As such, our method provides a bridge between theoretical
models of epidemiology and data-driven approaches for modeling of influenza and
other similar viruses.
  Our model extends the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model to higher
dimensions, allowing the modeling of a population infected by multiple viruses.
We further provide a method, based on an overcomplete dictionary of feasible
realizations of SIR solutions, to blindly partition the time series
representing the number of infected people in a population into individual
components, each representing the effect of a single pathogen.
  We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed method on five years of
seasonal influenza-like illness (ILI) rates, estimated from Twitter data. We
demonstrate that our method describes, on average, 44\% of the variance in the
ILI time series. The individual infectious components derived from our model
are matched to known viral profiles in the populations, which we demonstrate
matches that of independently collected epidemiological data. We further show

we show that the temporal evolution is critic for explaining the spectral-line

multivariate categorical time series, based on the mixture transition

of hybrid corn (measured as bushel per acre) by using both information on
yields contained in US patent documents for patented hybrid corn varieties and
on field-test data of several hybrid corn varieties performed at US State
level. We have used a generalization of Moore's law to fit productivity trends
and obtain the performance improvement rate by analyzing time series of hybrid
corn performance for a period covering the last thirty years. The linear
regressions results obtained from different data sources indicate that the
estimated improvement rates per year are between 1.2 and 2.4 percent. In
particular, using yields reported in a sample of patents filed between 1985 and
2010, we estimated an improvement rate of 0.015 (R2 = 0.74, Pvalue = 1.37 x

(2015) and Triulzi and Magee (2016) that only use patent metadata to estimate
the rate of improvement. We compare these predicted values to the rate
estimated using US States field-test data. We find that, due to a turning point
in patenting practices which begun in 2008, only the predicted rate (rate =
0.015) using patents filed before 2008 is consistent with the empirical rate.
Finally, we also investigate at the micro level - on the basis of 70 patents
(granted between 1986 and 2015) - whether the number of citations received by a
patent is correlated with performance achieved by the patented variety. We find
that the relative performance (yield ratio) of the patented seed is positively

binary (EB) systems in the sub-Gyr old Praesepe open cluster using Kepler/K2
time-series photometry and Keck/HIRES spectroscopy. We present a new Gaussian
process eclipsing binary model, GP-EBOP, as well as a method of simultaneously
determining effective temperatures and distances for EBs. Three of the reported
systems (AD 3814, AD 2615 and AD 1508) are detached and double-lined, and
precise solutions are presented for the first two. We determine masses and
radii to 1-3% precision for AD 3814 and to 5-6% for AD 2615. Together with
effective temperatures determined to $\sim$50 K precision, we test the PARSEC
v1.2 and BHAC15 stellar evolution models. Our EB parameters are more consistent
with the PARSEC models, primarily because the BHAC15 temperature scale is
hotter than our data over the mid M-dwarf mass range probed. Both ADs 3814 and
2615, which have orbital periods of 6.0 and 11.6 days, are circularized but not
synchronized. This suggests that either synchronization proceeds more slowly in
fully convective stars than the theory of equilibrium tides predicts or
magnetic braking is currently playing a more important role than tidal forces
in the spin evolution of these binaries. The fourth system (AD 3116) comprises
a brown dwarf transiting a mid M-dwarf, which is the first such system

multiple line distortions, which we interpret as cool starspots and which are
persistent on both nights suggesting stability on the timescale of 3 days.
Spots are recovered with resolutions down to 8.3 degs at the equator. The
global spot distributions for GJ 791.2A are similar to observations made a year

GJ791.2A and GJ 65A. However, they are surprisingly absent on GJ 65B, which
instead reveals more extensive, larger, spots concentrated at intermediate

we adopt an integral operator approach with periodic semigroup kernels.
Spectral decomposition theorems are derived that cover the important cases of
two-time statistics drawn from a mixing invariant measure.
  The corresponding eigenvalues can be grouped per Fourier frequency, and are
actually given, at each frequency, as the singular values of a cross-spectral
matrix depending on the data. These eigenvalues obey furthermore a variational
principle that allows us to define naturally a multidimensional power spectrum.
The eigenmodes, as far as they are concerned, exhibit a data-adaptive character
manifested in their phase which allows us in turn to define a multidimensional
phase spectrum.
  The resulting data-adaptive harmonic (DAH) modes allow for reducing the
data-driven modeling effort to elemental models stacked per frequency, only
coupled at different frequencies by the same noise realization. In particular,
the DAH decomposition extracts time-dependent coefficients stacked by Fourier
frequency which can be efficiently modeled---provided the decay of temporal
correlations is sufficiently well-resolved---within a class of multilayer
stochastic models (MSMs) tailored here on stochastic Stuart-Landau oscillators.
  Applications to the Lorenz 96 model and to a stochastic heat equation driven
by a space-time white noise, are considered. In both cases, the DAH
decomposition allows for an extraction of spatio-temporal modes revealing key
features of the dynamics in the embedded phase space. The multilayer

events in the solar system, impacting the near-Earth environment. Flare
productivity is empirically known to be correlated with the size and complexity
of active regions. Several indicators, based on magnetic-field data from active
regions, have been tested for flare forecasting in recent years. None of these
indicators, or combinations thereof, have yet demonstrated an unambiguous
eruption or flare criterion. Furthermore, numerical simulations have been only
barely used to test the predictability of these parameters. In this context, we
used the 3D parametric MHD numerical simulations of the self-consistent
formation of the flux emergence of a twisted flux tube, inducing the formation
of stable and unstable magnetic flux ropes of Leake (2013, 2014). We use these
numerical simulations to investigate the eruptive signatures observable in
various magnetic scalar parameters and provide highlights on data analysis
processing. Time series of 2D photospheric-like magnetograms are used from
parametric simulations of stable and unstable flux emergence, to compute a list

in Scorpius-Centaurus (Sco-Cen), the nearest OB association. We use SuperWASP
time-series photometry to extract rotation periods for 189 candidate members of

Sco-Cen subgroups of Upper Scorpius (US), Upper Centaurus-Lupus (UCL), and
Lower Centaurus-Crux (LCC). This study provides the first measurements of
rotation periods explicitly for large samples of pre-main sequence (pre-MS)
stars spanning the UCL and LCC subgroups. Our final sample of 157
well-characterized pre-MS stars spans ages of $\sim$ 10 -- 20 Myr, spectral
types of $\sim$ F3 -- M0, and masses of $M \simeq$ 0.3 -- 1.5 $\mathcal{M}^{\rm

periods with a median of $P_{\textrm{rot}} \simeq$ 2.4 days, overall range of
0.2 $<$ $P_{\textrm{rot}}$ $<$ 8 days, and a fairly well-defined mass-dependent
upper envelope of rotation periods. This distribution of periods is consistent
with recently developed stellar angular momentum evolution models. These data
are significant because they represent an undersampled age range and the number
of measurable rotation periods is large compared to recent studies of other
regions. We also search for new examples of eclipsing disk or ring systems

on-demand ride service platform, which can incentivize vacant cars moving from
over-supply regions to over-demand regions. The spatial dependences, temporal
dependences, and exogenous dependences need to be considered simultaneously,
however, which makes short-term passenger demand forecasting challenging. We
propose a novel deep learning (DL) approach, named the fusion convolutional
long short-term memory network (FCL-Net), to address these three dependences
within one end-to-end learning architecture. The model is stacked and fused by
multiple convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, standard LSTM
layers, and convolutional layers. The fusion of convolutional techniques and
the LSTM network enables the proposed DL approach to better capture the

tailored spatially aggregated random forest is employed to rank the importance
of the explanatory variables. The ranking is then used for feature selection.
The proposed DL approach is applied to the short-term forecasting of passenger
demand under an on-demand ride service platform in Hangzhou, China.
Experimental results, validated on real-world data provided by DiDi Chuxing,
show that the FCL-Net achieves better predictive performance than traditional

are becoming prevalent in many application domains. Almost always, these

change, affect the original model underpinning the predictor, leading to an

The
relationship between the cycle properties and global stellar parameters is not

  We searched for activity cycles in 90 solar-like stars with ages between 4
and 95 Myr aiming to investigate the properties of activity cycles in this age
range.
  We measured the length $P_{ cyc}$ of a given cycle by analyzing the long-term
time-series of three activity indexes. For each star, we computed also the
global magnetic activity index <IQR> that is proportional to the amplitude of
the rotational modulation and is a proxy of the mean level of the surface
magnetic activity. We detected activity cycles in 67 stars. Secondary cycles
were also detected in 32 stars. The lack of correlation between $P_{ cyc}$ and
$P_{ rot}$ suggest that these stars belong to the Transitional Branch and that
the dynamo acting in these stars is different from the solar one. This
statement is also supported by the analysis of the butterfly diagrams.
  We computed the Spearman correlation coefficient $r_{ S}$ between $P_{ cyc}$,
<IQR> and different stellar parameters. We found that $P_{ cyc}$ is
uncorrelated with all the investigated parameters. The <IQR> index is
positively correlated with the convective turn-over time-scale, the magnetic
diffusivity time-scale $\tau_{ diff}$, and the dynamo number $D_{ N}$, whereas
it is anti-correlated with the effective temperature $T_{ eff}$, the
photometric shear $\Delta\Omega_{\rm phot}$ and the radius $R_{ C}$ at which
the convective zone is located.
  We found that $P_{ cyc}$ is about constant and that <IQR> decreases with the

lines of k-space to determine and correct line-to-line trajectory delays and
phase errors that cause ghosting artifacts. EPI-TrACR was applied to in vivo
data acquired at 7 Tesla across acceleration and multishot factors, and in a

to conventional calibrated reconstructions, EPI-TrACR reduced ghosting up to
moderate acceleration factors and across multishot factors. It also maintained
low ghosting in a dynamic time series. Averaged over all cases, EPI-TrACR
reduced root-mean-square ghosted signal outside the brain by 27% compared to

Type-II Cepheids will be updated shortly. Thanks to high completeness of the
OGLE survey the sample of classical Cepheids includes virtually all stars of
this type in the Magellanic Clouds. Thus, the OGLE survey concludes the work
started by Leavitt.

evaluation of these time-series, however, is expensive and prone to biased and
non-reproducible outcomes. In this paper, we present a method that addresses
named limitations by integrating segmentation and disease classification into a

architectures for segmentation of cardiac structures such as the left and right
ventricular cavity (LVC, RVC) and the left ventricular myocardium (LVM) on each
time instance of the cardiac cycle. For the classification task, information is
extracted from the segmented time-series in form of comprehensive features

diagnosis of sleep disorders. It is traditionally performed by a sleep expert
who assigns to each 30s of signal a sleep stage, based on the visual inspection
of signals such as electroencephalograms (EEG), electrooculograms (EOG),
electrocardiograms (ECG) and electromyograms (EMG). We introduce here the first
deep learning approach for sleep stage classification that learns end-to-end
without computing spectrograms or extracting hand-crafted features, that
exploits all multivariate and multimodal Polysomnography (PSG) signals (EEG,
EMG and EOG), and that can exploit the temporal context of each 30s window of
data. For each modality the first layer learns linear spatial filters that
exploit the array of sensors to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and the
last layer feeds the learnt representation to a softmax classifier. Our model
is compared to alternative automatic approaches based on convolutional networks
or decisions trees. Results obtained on 61 publicly available PSG records with
up to 20 EEG channels demonstrate that our network architecture yields
state-of-the-art performance. Our study reveals a number of insights on the
spatio-temporal distribution of the signal of interest: a good trade-off for
optimal classification performance measured with balanced accuracy is to use 6
EEG with 2 EOG (left and right) and 3 EMG chin channels. Also exploiting one
minute of data before and after each data segment offers the strongest
improvement when a limited number of channels is available. As sleep experts,

the period: 1996 - 2016. The main results obtained are: 1) The temporal
behavior of monthly means of daily total SSC in flaring and non-flaring active
regions are different and these differences are also varying from cycle to

113 days, while there are much higher periodicities (327, 312, and 256 days) in

a review of the properties of 35 JFCs with previously published rotation

  The photometric time-series were obtained in Bessel R, Harris R and SDSS r'
filters and were absolutely calibrated using stars from the Pan-STARRS survey.
This specially-developed method allowed us to combine data sets taken at
different epochs and instruments with absolute-calibration uncertainty down to
0.02 mag. We used the resulting time series to improve the rotation periods for
comets 14P/Wolf, 47P/Ashbrook-Jackson, 94P/Russell, and 110P/Hartley 3 and to
determine the rotation rates of comets 93P/Lovas and 162P/Siding-Spring for the

the examined comets and derived geometric albedos for eight of them.
  We confirm the known cut-off in bulk densities at $\sim$0.6 g

We build projected networks (onto the set of nodes represented\nby MPs) and proceed to the study of the dynamical changes of their topology,\nincluding community structure.

approximately seven years. Since all cyber events were validated by analysts,
our dataset is unlikely to have false positives which are often endemic in

two Magellanic Clouds and their connecting Bridge. Here we present YJKs light
curves for a sample of 717 Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) Classical Cepheids
(CCs). These data, complemented with our previous results and V magnitude from
literature, allowed us to construct a variety of period-luminosity and
period-Wesenheit relationships, valid for Fundamental, First and Second
Overtone pulsators. These relations provide accurate individual distances to
CCs in the SMC over an area of more than 40 sq. deg. Adopting literature
relations, we estimated ages and metallicities for the majority of the
investigated pulsators, finding that: i) the age distribution is bimodal, with
two peaks at 120+-10 and 220+-10 Myr; ii) the more metal-rich CCs appear to be
located closer to the centre of the galaxy. Our results show that the
three-dimensional distribution of the CCs in the SMC, is not planar but heavily
elongated for more than 25-30 kpc approximately in the east/north-east towards
south-west direction. The young and old CCs in the SMC show a different
geometric distribution. Our data support the current theoretical scenario
predicting a close encounter or a direct collision between the Clouds some 200
Myr ago and confirm the presence of a Counter-Bridge predicted by some models.

These data, complemented with our previous results and V magnitude from\nliterature, allowed us to construct a variety of period-luminosity and\nperiod-Wesenheit relationships, valid for Fundamental, First and Second\nOvertone pulsators. These relations provide accurate individual distances to\nCCs in the SMC over an area of more than 40 sq. deg. Adopting literature\nrelations, we estimated ages and metallicities for the majority of the\ninvestigated pulsators, finding that: i) the age distribution is bimodal, with\ntwo peaks at 120+-10 and 220+-10 Myr; ii) the more metal-rich CCs appear to be\nlocated closer to the centre of the galaxy. Our results show that the\nthree-dimensional distribution of the CCs in the SMC, is not planar but heavily\nelongated for more than 25-30 kpc approximately in the east/north-east towards\nsouth-west direction. The young and old CCs in the SMC show a different\ngeometric distribution. Our data support the current theoretical scenario\npredicting a close encounter or a direct collision between the Clouds some 200\nMyr ago and confirm the presence of a Counter-Bridge predicted by some models.\nThe high precision three-dimensional distribution of young stars presented in\nthis paper provides a new testbed for future models exploring the formation and\nevolution of the Magellanic System.'}","[{'name': 'Vincenzo Ripepi'}, {'name': 'Maria-Rosa L.

Spectroscopic stellar parameters are desirable to characterize and select
suitable targets for TESS, whether they are focused on exploring exoplanets,
stellar astrophysics, or Galactic archaeology. Here, we present spectroscopic
stellar parameters ($T_{\rm eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v \sin i$, $v_{\rm

stellar properties including distance, extinction, mass, radius, and age using
theoretical isochrones. Stellar surface gravity and radius are made available
for an additional set of roughly 8,500 red giants. All our target stars are in
the range $10<V<13.1$. Among them, we identify and list 227 stars belonging to
the Large Magellanic Cloud. The data were taken using the the High Efficiency

WASP-4b has an equilibrium temperature of 1700 K and is favorable to study in
transmission due to a large scale height (370 km). We derive the transmission
spectrum of WASP-4b using 4 transits observed with the MOS technique. We
demonstrate repeatable results across multiple epochs with GMOS, and derive a
combined transmission spectrum at a precision about twice above photon noise,
which is roughly equal to to one atmospheric scale height. The transmission
spectrum is well fitted with a uniform opacity as a function of wavelength. The
uniform opacity and absence of a Rayleigh slope from molecular hydrogen suggest
that the atmosphere is dominated by clouds with condensate grain size of ~1 um.
This result is consistent with previous observations of hot Jupiters since
clouds have been seen in planets with similar equilibrium temperatures to
WASP-4b. We describe a custom pipeline that we have written to reduce GMOS

giant stars in the open star cluster NGC 6819. By employing sophisticated
pre-processing of the time series and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques we
extracted individual frequencies, heights and linewidths for hundreds of
oscillation modes.
  We show that the ""average"" asteroseismic parameter $\delta\nu_{02}$, derived
from these, can be used to distinguish the stellar evolutionary state between
the red giant branch (RGB) stars and red clump (RC) stars.
  Masses and radii are estimated using asteroseismic scaling relations, both
empirically corrected to obtain self-consistency as well as agreement with
independent measures of distance, and using updated theoretical corrections.
Remarkable agreement is found, allowing the evolutionary state of the giants to
be determined exclusively from the empirical correction to the scaling
relations. We find a mean mass of the RGB stars and RC stars in NGC 6819 to be
$1.61\pm0.02\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ and $1.64{\pm}0.02\,\textrm{M}_\odot$,
respectively. The difference $\Delta M=-0.03\pm0.01\,\textrm{M}_\odot$ is
almost insensitive to systematics, suggesting very little RGB mass loss, if
any.
  Stars that are outliers relative to the ensemble reveal overmassive members
that likely evolved via mass-transfer in a blue straggler phase. We suggest
that KIC 4937011, a low-mass Li-rich giant, is a cluster member in the RC phase

a disk-driven outflow or jet. We obtained high-resolution optical spectra from
the HERMES spectrograph, mounted on the 1.2m Flemish Mercator Telescope. By
performing a time-series analysis of the Halpha profile, we dissected the
different components of the system. We deduced the jet geometry by comparing
the orbital phased data with our jet model. In order to image the accretion
disk around the companion of BD+46$^{\circ}$442, we applied the technique of
Doppler tomography. The orbital phase-dependent variations in the Halpha
profile can be related to an accretion disk around the companion, from which a
high-velocity outflow or jet is launched. Our model shows that there is a clear
correlation between the inclination angle and the jet opening angle. The
latitudinally dependent velocity structure of our jet model shows a good
correspondence to the data, with outflow velocities at least higher than

atmosphere, but the amount and frequency of dust-lifting depend on the
statistical distribution of dust devil parameters. Dust devils exhibit pressure
perturbations and, if they pass near a barometric sensor, they may register as
a discernible dip in a pressure time-series. Leveraging this fact, several
surveys using barometric sensors on landed spacecraft have revealed dust devil
structures and occurrence rates. However powerful they are, though, such
surveys suffer from non-trivial biases that skew the inferred dust devil
properties. For example, such surveys are most sensitive to dust devils with
the widest and deepest pressure profiles, but the recovered profiles will be
distorted, broader and shallow than the actual profiles. In addition, such
surveys often do not provide wind speed measurements alongside the pressure
time series, and so the durations of the dust devil signals in the time series
cannot be directly converted to profile widths. Fortunately, simple statistical
and geometric considerations can de-bias these surveys, allowing conversion of
the duration of dust devil signals into physical widths, given only a
distribution of likely translation velocities, and the recovery of the
underlying distributions of physical parameters. In this study, we develop a
scheme for de-biasing such surveys. Applying our model to an in-situ survey
using data from the Phoenix lander suggests a larger dust flux and a dust devil
occurrence rate about ten times larger than previously inferred. Comparing our
results to dust devil track surveys suggests only about one in five
low-pressure cells lifts sufficient dust to leave a visible track.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=6000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Dust devils are likely the dominant source of dust for the martian\natmosphere, but the amount and frequency of dust-lifting depend on the\nstatistical distribution of dust devil parameters.

from such assumptions, we derive non-asymptotic inequalities for estimation

represent an intriguing period of stellar evolution, i.e. when the convective
envelope interacts with the fast-rotating core. During these mixing episodes
freshly synthesized lithium can come up to the stellar surface along with high
angular momentum material. This high angular momentum may alter the surface
rotation pattern.
  Aims: The single rapidly rotating K-giant V1192 Ori is revisited to determine
its surface differential rotation, lithium abundance, and basic stellar
properties such as a precise rotation period. The aim is to independently
verify the antisolar differential rotation of the star and possibly find a
connection to the surface lithium abundance.
  Methods: We applied time-series Doppler imaging to a new multi-epoch data
set. Altogether we reconstructed 11 Doppler images from spectroscopic data
collected with the STELLA robotic telescope between 2007--2016. We used our

bump. We measure $A({\rm Li})_{\rm NLTE}=1.27$, i.e. a value close to the

images reveal extended dark areas arranged quasi-evenly along an equatorial

previously unknown to be variable. The physical mechanism responsible for the
observed variability is likely different for the two objects. The variability
of the first object, a single-lined spectroscopic binary, is most likely linked
to its accretion disc, the second may be caused by variable extinction by large
grains. We find five new candidate members from the colour-magnitude diagram

membership inference attacks on aggregate location time-series. We introduce a
game-based definition of the adversarial task, and cast it as a classification
problem where machine learning can be used to distinguish whether or not a
target user is part of the aggregates.
  We empirically evaluate the power of these attacks on both raw and
differentially private aggregates using two mobility datasets. We find that
membership inference is a serious privacy threat, and show how its
effectiveness depends on the adversary's prior knowledge, the characteristics
of the underlying location data, as well as the number of users and the
timeframe on which aggregation is performed. Although differentially private
mechanisms can indeed reduce the extent of the attacks, they also yield a
significant loss in utility. Moreover, a strategic adversary mimicking the
behavior of the defense mechanism can greatly limit the protection they
provide. Overall, our work presents a novel methodology geared to evaluate

negative effects to the trustworthiness of recommender systems, and thus affect
the effectiveness of recommendation engines. In this work, we investigate
explainable recommendation in aspects of data explainability, model
explainability, and result explainability, and the main contributions are as
follows:
  1. Data Explainability: We propose Localized Matrix Factorization (LMF)
framework based Bordered Block Diagonal Form (BBDF) matrices, and further
applied this technique for parallelized matrix factorization.
  2. Model Explainability: We propose Explicit Factor Models (EFM) based on
phrase-level sentiment analysis, as well as dynamic user preference modeling
based on time series analysis. In this work, we extract product features and
user opinions towards different features from large-scale user textual reviews
based on phrase-level sentiment analysis techniques, and introduce the EFM
approach for explainable model learning and recommendation.
  3. Economic Explainability: We propose the Total Surplus Maximization (TSM)
framework for personalized recommendation, as well as the model specification
in different types of online applications. Based on basic economic concepts, we
provide the definitions of utility, cost, and surplus in the application
scenario of Web services, and propose the general framework of web total

Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) can be used to address numerous
questions in astrophysics and cosmology. Due to their well known spectral and
photometric properties, SNe Ia are well suited to study gas and dust along the
lines-of-sight to the explosions. For example, narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K
absorption lines can be studied easily, because of the well-defined spectral
continuum of SNe Ia around these features. Aims. We study the gas and dust
along the line-of-sight to iPTF16abc, which occurred in an unusual location, in
a tidal arm, 80 kpc from centre of the galaxy NGC 5221. Methods. Using a
time-series of high-resolution spectra, we examine narrow Na I D and Ca II H&K
absorption features for variations in time, which would be indicative for
circumstellar (CS) matter. Furthermore, we take advantage of the well known
photometric properties of SNe Ia to determine reddening due to dust along the
line-of-sight. Results. From the lack of variations in Na I D and Ca II H&K, we
determine that none of the detected absorption features originate from the CS
medium of iPTF16abc. While the Na I D and Ca II H&K absorption is found to be
optically thick, a negligible amount of reddening points to a small column of
interstellar dust. Conclusions. We find that the gas along the line-of-sight to
iPTF16abc is typical of what might be found in the interstellar medium (ISM)
within a galaxy. It suggests that we are observing gas that has been tidally
stripped during an interaction of NGC 5221 with one of its neighbouring
galaxies in the past $\sim10^9$ years. In the future, the gas clouds could
become the locations of star formation. On a longer time scale, the clouds

population synthesis models and a Galactic potential to reconstruct the SN
activity of these OCs during the past 35 Myr. We find that several OCs
potentially hosting SN progenitors have passed within 100 pc of the Sun during
the past 35 Myr. In particular we find that ASCC 19, NGC 1981, and NGC 1976 are
likely to have hosted one or more SNe while passing within 200 pc of the solar
system in the period 17 - 12 Myr BP which might have affected Earths' geology
and climate. Besides the stellar history of the individual OCs we also compute
1) a spatial and temporal 2D-probability density map showing the most likely
position and time of SN from our sample of OCs within 1 kpc during the past 35
Myr, 2) the time series of the SN rate per volume and 3) the relative SN rate
compared with today and corrected for OC evaporation of older generations. The
SN rate today from core collapse is estimated to be 37.8$\pm$6.1$\rm kpc^{-3}

present (BP) where the rate was 40% higher relative to the past 1 Myr. Finally

prediction step and an update step, similarly to the Kalman filter. We
illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach using different numerical
simulations where D-NMF significantly outperforms its static counterpart.

The proposed method does not\nassume a particular model for the light curve nor its underlying probability\ndensity and it is robust to non-Gaussian noise and outliers. By combining the\nQMI from several bands the true period can be estimated even when no\nsingle-band QMI yields the period. Period recovery performance as a function of\naverage magnitude and sample size is measured using 30,000 synthetic multi-band\nlight curves of RR Lyrae and Cepheid variables generated by the LSST Operations\nand Catalog simulators. The results show that aggregating information from\nseveral bands is highly beneficial in LSST sparsely-sampled time series,\nobtaining an absolute increase in period recovery rate up to 50%. We also show\nthat the QMI is more robust to noise and light curve length (sample size) than\nthe multiband generalizations of the Lomb Scargle and Analysis of Variance\nperiodograms, recovering the true period in 10-30% more cases than its\ncompetitors. A python package containing efficient Cython implementations of\nthe QMI and other methods is provided.'}","[{'name': 'Pablo Huijse'}, {'name': 'Pablo A.

scenarios and appropriately interact with other road users, requires the
ability to semantically learn and understand driving environment, oftentimes,
based on analyzing massive amounts of naturalistic driving data. An important
paradigm that allows automated vehicles to both learn from human drivers and
gain insights is understanding the principal compositions of the entire
traffic, termed as traffic primitives. However, the exploding data growth
presents a great challenge in extracting primitives from high-dimensional
time-series traffic data with various types of road users engaged. Therefore,
automatically extracting primitives is becoming one of the cost-efficient ways
to help autonomous vehicles understand and predict the complex traffic
scenarios. In addition, the extracted primitives from raw data should 1) be
appropriate for automated driving applications and also 2) be easily used to
generate new traffic scenarios. However, existing literature does not provide a
method to automatically learn these primitives from large-scale traffic data.
The contribution of this paper has two manifolds. The first one is that we
proposed a new framework to generate new traffic scenarios from a handful of
limited traffic data. The second one is that we introduce a nonparametric
Bayesian learning method -- a sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden
Markov model -- to automatically extract primitives from multidimensional
traffic data without prior knowledge of the primitive settings. The developed
method is then validated using one day of naturalistic driving data. Experiment
results show that the nonparametric Bayesian learning method is able to extract

machine learning to anomaly detection for a Cyber-Physical System (CPS). We
compare two methods: Deep Neural Networks (DNN) adapted to time series data
generated by a CPS, and one-class Support Vector Machines (SVM). These methods
are evaluated against data from the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) testbed, a
scaled-down but fully operational raw water purification plant. For both
methods, we first train detectors using a log generated by SWaT operating under
normal conditions. Then, we evaluate the performance of both methods using a
log generated by SWaT operating under 36 different attack scenarios. We find
that our DNN generates fewer false positives than our one-class SVM while our
SVM detects slightly more anomalies. Overall, our DNN has a slightly better F

outage detection, and to get a broad baseline view of the Internet evolution
over time. However, despite the large amount of investigations, the dynamic
aspects of these measures have not been fully understood. As an example,
looking at time-series of such measures, patterns that repeat at regular

randomly generated measures containing artificial periodicities. Second, we
exploit the algorithm to verify how frequently traceroute sequences extracted
from popular databases of topology measures exhibit a periodic behavior. We
show that a surprisingly high percentage of measures present one or more

the health of the device and the electric power grid from the edge. This is
realized by exploiting unsupervised machine learning algorithms on multiple

smart home and solar datasets to simulate the smart grid scenarios and to
illustrate the impact of PV attacks on the power system. Various attacks

to their users. However, even if user data is anonymized and obfuscated, a
user's privacy can be compromised through the use of statistical matching
techniques that match a user trace to prior user behavior. In this work, we
derive the theoretical bounds on the privacy of users in such a scenario. We
build on our recent study in the area of location privacy, in which we
introduced formal notions of location privacy for anonymization-based location
privacy-protection mechanisms. Here we derive the fundamental limits of user
privacy when both anonymization and obfuscation-based protection mechanisms are
applied to users' time series of data. We investigate the impact of such
mechanisms on the trade-off between privacy protection and user utility. We
first study achievability results for the case where the time-series of users
are governed by an i.i.d. process. The converse results are proved both for the
i.i.d. case as well as the more general Markov chain model. We demonstrate that
as the number of users in the network grows, the obfuscation-anonymization

recognition task by automatically learning a hierarchical feature
representation from raw data. While the majority of Time-Series Classification
(TSC) literature is focused on 1D signals, this paper uses Recurrence Plots
(RP) to transform time-series into 2D texture images and then take advantage of
the deep CNN classifier. Image representation of time-series introduces
different feature types that are not available for 1D signals, and therefore
TSC can be treated as texture image recognition task. CNN model also allows
learning different levels of representations together with a classifier,
jointly and automatically. Therefore, using RP and CNN in a unified framework
is expected to boost the recognition rate of TSC. Experimental results on the

of the eastern US. Aside from a few islands in the north, the islands are
uninhabited and managed for conservation. These islands play important
environmental, cultural, and economic roles along Virginia's Eastern Shore.
Climate change driven sea-level rise is already having a major impact on these
islands and threatens their existence. We utilize transect analysis across each
of the barrier islands to depict the shoreline change trends annually from 1850
to 2010. We then utilize time series forecasting and panel modeling to estimate
future shorelines up to and including a best estimate 2099 CE shoreline.
Results indicate that across almost all the islands, the shoreline retreat rate
has been increasing over time. Additionally, we find that year 2100 CE

properties including Bond albedo, heat redistribution efficiency (i.e., ratio
between radiative timescale and advective timescale of the atmosphere), and
atmospheric greenhouse factor. The phase curve of 55 Cancri e is dominated by
thermal emission with an eastward-shifted hot spot. We determine the heat
redistribution efficiency to be ~1.47, which implies that the advective
timescale is on the same order as the radiative timescale. This requirement
cannot be met by the bare-rock planet scenario because heat transport by
currents of molten lava would be too slow. The phase curve thus favors the
scenario with a substantial atmosphere. Our constraints on the heat

mining multi-dimensional heterogeneous time series data, the lack of

(aLIGO)/Virgo event GW170817 opens up new avenues of multi-messenger
astrophysics. Here, using realistic simulations, we provide estimates of the
number of KNe that could be found in data from past, present and future surveys
without a gravitational-wave trigger. For the simulation, we construct a
spectral time-series model based on the DES-GW multi-band light-curve from the
single known KN event, and we use an average of BNS rates from past studies of
$10^3 \rm{Gpc}^{-3}/\rm{year}$, consistent with the $1$ event found so far.
Examining past and current datasets from transient surveys, the number of KNe
we expect to find for ASAS-SN, SDSS, PS1, SNLS, DES, and SMT is between 0 and
$0.3$. We predict the number of detections per future survey to be: 8.3 from
ATLAS, 10.6 from ZTF, 5.5/69 from LSST (the Deep Drilling / Wide Fast Deep),

z = 0.8 for WFIRST, z = 0.25 for LSST and z = 0.04 for ZTF and ATLAS. For the
LSST survey, we also provide contamination estimates from Type Ia and
Core-collapse supernovae: after light-curve and template-matching requirements,
we estimate a background of just 2 events. More broadly, we stress that future
transient surveys should consider how to optimize their search strategies to
improve their detection efficiency, and to consider similar analyses for GW

stellar evolution models indicated that the primary star resides inside the
$\delta$ Sct instability strip on the main sequence, while the cool secondary
component is noticeably overluminous and oversized. We demonstrated that OO Dra
is an oscillating post-mass transfer R CMa-type binary; the originally more
massive star became the low-mass secondary component through mass loss caused
by stellar wind and mass transfer, and the gainer became the pulsating primary

to have formed by non-conservative binary evolution and ultimately to evolve

wearable devices generate time-series measurements of physical activities.
Though access to the sensory data is critical to the success of many beneficial
applications such as health monitoring or activity recognition, a wide range of
potentially sensitive information about the individuals can also be discovered
through access to sensory data and this cannot easily be protected using
traditional privacy approaches.
  In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving sensing framework for managing
access to time-series data in order to provide utility while protecting
individuals' privacy. We introduce Replacement AutoEncoder, a novel algorithm
which learns how to transform discriminative features of data that correspond
to sensitive inferences, into some features that have been more observed in
non-sensitive inferences, to protect users' privacy. This efficiency is
achieved by defining a user-customized objective function for deep
autoencoders. Our replacement method will not only eliminate the possibility of
recognizing sensitive inferences, it also eliminates the possibility of
detecting the occurrence of them. That is the main weakness of other approaches
such as filtering or randomization. We evaluate the efficacy of the algorithm
with an activity recognition task in a multi-sensing environment using
extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets. We show that it can retain
the recognition accuracy of state-of-the-art techniques while simultaneously
preserving the privacy of sensitive information. Finally, we utilize the GANs
for detecting the occurrence of replacement, after releasing data, and show
that this can be done only if the adversarial network is trained on the users'

turbulence via the method of reconstructing attractor geometry from measurement

computationally demanding task because of the high temporal fluctuation of
supply and demand time series. In order to reduce these time series, the
aggregation of typical operation periods has become common. The problem with
this method is that these aggregated typical periods are modeled independently
and cannot exchange energy. Therefore, seasonal storage cannot be adequately
taken into account, although this will be necessary for energy systems with a
high share of renewable generation.
  To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel mathematical description

essential tool for understanding brain function and networks. However, due to
the sheer size of tfMRI data, its intrinsic complex structure, and lack of
ground truth of underlying neural activities, modeling tfMRI data is hard and
challenging. Previously proposed data-modeling methods including Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) and Sparse Dictionary Learning only provided a weakly
established model based on blind source separation under the strong assumption
that original fMRI signals could be linearly decomposed into time series
components with corresponding spatial maps. Meanwhile, analyzing and learning a
large amount of tfMRI data from a variety of subjects has been shown to be very
demanding but yet challenging even with technological advances in computational
hardware. Given the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a robust method for
learning high-level abstractions from low-level data such as tfMRI time series,
in this work we propose a fast and scalable novel framework for distributed
deep Convolutional Autoencoder model. This model aims to both learn the complex
hierarchical structure of the tfMRI data and to leverage the processing power
of multiple GPUs in a distributed fashion. To implement such a model, we have
created an enhanced processing pipeline on the top of Apache Spark and
Tensorflow library, leveraging from a very large cluster of GPU machines.

We illustrate this model by demonstrating the\napplicability of a linear model for the non-linear systematics in K2\ntime-series data, where the dominant noise source for many stars is spacecraft\nmotion and variability.'}","[{'name': 'Rodrigo Luger'}, {'name': 'Daniel Foreman-Mackey'}, {'name': 'David W.

detectable only through searches for single pulses. While over 100 RRATs have
been detected, only a small fraction (roughly 20\%) have phase-connected timing
solutions, which are critical for determining how they relate to other neutron
star populations. Detecting more pulses in order to achieve solutions is a key
to understanding their physical nature. Astronomical signals collected by radio
telescopes contain noise from many sources, making the detection of weak pulses
difficult. Applying a denoising method to raw time series prior to performing a
single-pulse search typically leads to a more accurate estimation of their
times of arrival (TOAs). Taking into account some features of RRAT pulses and
noise, we present a denoising method based on wavelet data analysis, an
image-processing technique. Assuming that the spin period of an RRAT is known,
we estimate the frequency spectrum components contributing to the composition
of RRAT pulses. This allows us to suppress the noise, which contributes to
other frequencies. We apply the wavelet denoising method including selective
wavelet reconstruction and wavelet shrinkage to the de-dispersed time series of
eight RRATs with existing timing solutions. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of
most pulses are improved after wavelet denoising. Compared to the conventional
approach, we measure 12% to 69% more TOAs for the eight RRATs. The new timing

detecting exoplanets. It works by detecting the velocity of a host star induced
by the gravitational effect of an orbiting planet, specifically the velocity
along our line of sight, which is called the radial velocity of the star.
Low-mass planets typically cause their host star to move with radial velocities
of 1 m/s or less. By analyzing a time series of stellar spectra from a host
star, modern astronomical instruments can in theory detect such planets.
However, in practice, intrinsic stellar variability (e.g., star spots,
convective motion, pulsations) affects the spectra and often mimics a radial
velocity signal. This signal contamination makes it difficult to reliably
detect low-mass planets. A principled approach to recovering planet radial
velocity signals in the presence of stellar activity was proposed by Rajpaul et
al. (2015). It uses a multivariate Gaussian process model to jointly capture
time series of the apparent radial velocity and multiple indicators of stellar
activity. We build on this work in two ways: (i) we propose using dimension
reduction techniques to construct new high-information stellar activity
indicators; and (ii) we extend the Rajpaul et al. (2015) model to a larger

best model. Despite significant interest in exoplanets, previous efforts have

(RC) models, such as Echo State Networks, have attracted widespread attention
in the last decade. However, while they have had great success with time series

single-hidden-layer RC model may have difficulty capturing. In this paper, we
propose a novel hierarchical reservoir computing framework we call Deep Echo
State Networks (Deep-ESNs). The most distinctive feature of a Deep-ESN is its
ability to deal with time series through hierarchical projections.
Specifically, when an input time series is projected into the high-dimensional
echo-state space of a reservoir, a subsequent encoding layer (e.g., a PCA,
autoencoder, or a random projection) can project the echo-state representations
into a lower-dimensional space. These low-dimensional representations can then
be processed by another ESN. By using projection layers and encoding layers
alternately in the hierarchical framework, a Deep-ESN can not only attenuate
the effects of the collinearity problem in ESNs, but also fully take advantage
of the temporal kernel property of ESNs to explore multiscale dynamics of time
series. To fuse the multiscale representations obtained by each reservoir, we
add connections from each encoding layer to the last output layer. Theoretical
analyses prove that stability of a Deep-ESN is guaranteed by the echo state
property (ESP), and the time complexity is equivalent to a conventional ESN.
Experimental results on some artificial and real world time series demonstrate
that Deep-ESNs can capture multiscale dynamics, and outperform both standard

'Oumuamua (1I) taken on 2017 October 29 from 04:28 to 08:40 UTC by the Apache
Point Observatory (APO) 3.5m telescope's ARCTIC camera. We find that 1I's
colors are $g-r=0.41\pm0.24$ and $r-i=0.23\pm0.25$, consistent with the visible
spectra of Masiero (2017), Ye et al. (2017) and Fitzsimmons et al. (2017), and
most comparable to the population of Solar System C/D asteroids, Trojans, or
comets. We find no evidence of any cometary activity at a heliocentric distance
of 1.46 au, approximately 1.5 months after 1I's closest approach distance to
the Sun. Significant brightness variability was seen in the $r$ observations,
with the object becoming notably brighter towards the end of the run. By
combining our APO photometric time series data with the Discovery Channel
Telescope (DCT) data of Knight et al. (2017), taken 20 h later on 2017 October

period of 8.1 $\pm$ 0.02 h, with a peak-to-peak amplitude of 1.5 - 2.1 mags.
Assuming that 1I's shape can be approximated by an ellipsoid, the amplitude
constraint implies that 1I has an axial ratio of 3.5 to 10.3, which is
strikingly elongated. Assuming that 1I is rotating above its critical break up
limit, our results are compatible with 1I having having modest cohesive
strength and may have obtained its elongated shape during a tidal disruption

both p- and g-modes. By studying the arrival times of the p-mode maxima and
minima through the O-C method, in a previous article the presence of a planet
was inferred with an orbital period of 3.2 yr and a minimum mass of 3.2 M_Jup.
Here we present an updated O-C analysis using a larger data set of 1066 hours
of photometric time series (~2.5x larger in terms of the number of data
points), which covers the period between 1999 and 2012 (compared with 1999-2006
of the previous analysis). Up to the end of 2008, the new O-C diagram of the
main pulsation frequency (f1) is compatible with (and improves) the previous
two-component solution representing the long-term variation of the pulsation
period (parabolic component) and the giant planet (sine wave component). Since
2009, the O-C trend of f1 changes, and the time derivative of the pulsation
period (p_dot) passes from positive to negative; the reason of this change of
regime is not clear and could be related to nonlinear interactions between
different pulsation modes. With the new data, the O-C diagram of the secondary
pulsation frequency (f2) continues to show two components (parabola and sine
wave), like in the previous analysis. Various solutions are proposed to fit the
O-C diagrams of f1 and f2, but in all of them, the sinusoidal components of f1
and f2 differ or at least agree less well than before. The nice agreement found
previously was a coincidence due to various small effects that are carefully
analysed. Now, with a larger dataset, the presence of a planet is more
uncertain and would require confirmation with an independent method. The new
data allow us to improve the measurement of p_dot for f1 and f2: using only the

the operation of electrical energy grids as the capacity of installed wind
power grows. The majority of predictive wind speed modeling has focused on
point-based time-series forecasting. Effectively balancing demand and supply in
the presence of distributed wind turbine electricity generation, however,
requires the prediction of wind fields in space and time. Additionally,
predictions of full wind fields are particularly useful for future power
planning such as the optimization of electricity power supply systems. In this
paper, we propose a composite artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict
the 6-hour and 24-hour ahead average wind speed over a large area (~3.15*106
km2). The ANN model consists of a convolutional input layer, a Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) hidden layer, and a transposed convolutional layer as the output
layer. We compare the ANN model with two non-parametric models, a null
persistence model and a mean value model, and find that the ANN model has
substantially smaller error than each of these models. Additionally, the ANN

However, modeling cycles
in time series data is challenging because in most cases the cycles are not
labeled or directly observed and need to be inferred from multidimensional

model method for detecting and modeling cycles in a collection of
multidimensional heterogeneous time series data. In contrast to previous cycle
modeling methods, CyHMMs deal with a number of challenges encountered in
modeling real-world cycles: they can model multivariate data with discrete and
continuous dimensions; they explicitly model and are robust to missing data;
and they can share information across individuals to model variation both
within and between individual time series. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world health-tracking data demonstrate that CyHMMs infer cycle lengths
more accurately than existing methods, with 58% lower error on simulated data
and 63% lower error on real-world data compared to the best-performing
baseline. CyHMMs can also perform functions which baselines cannot: they can
model the progression of individual features/symptoms over the course of the
cycle, identify the most variable features, and cluster individual time series
into groups with distinct characteristics. Applying CyHMMs to two real-world
health-tracking datasets -- of menstrual cycle symptoms and physical activity
tracking data -- yields important insights including which symptoms to expect
at each point during the cycle. We also find that people fall into several
groups with distinct cycle patterns, and that these groups differ along
dimensions not provided to the model. For example, by modeling missing data in

simultaneous identification of both changepoints and graphical dependency
structure in multivariate time-series. Traditionally, estimation of Gaussian
Graphical Models (GGM) is performed in an i.i.d setting. More recently, such
models have been extended to allow for changes in the distribution, but only
where changepoints are known a-priori. In this work, we study the Group-Fused
Graphical Lasso (GFGL) which penalises partial-correlations with an L1 penalty
while simultaneously inducing block-wise smoothness over time to detect

components of the complex, frequency-dependent response function $\chi(\omega)

improves the high-frequency fidelity of $\chi(\omega)$ relative to the use of
KK transformation, which has been shown to lead to artifacts in
$\chi^{\prime}(\omega)$. We test our method on both model data and experimental
data. Experiments were performed on solutions of worm-like micelles and dilute
collagen solutions. While the present method agrees well with established

multiple objects in dense configurations is an important and unsolved problem.
In the past, limitations of image analysis have restricted studies of dense
groups to tracking a single or subset of marked individuals, or to
coarse-grained group-level dynamics, all of which yield incomplete information.
Here, we combine convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the model
environment of a honeybee hive to automatically recognize all individuals in a
dense group from raw image data. We create new, adapted individual labeling and
use the segmentation architecture U-Net with a loss function dependent on both
object identity and orientation. We additionally exploit temporal regularities
of the video recording in a recurrent manner and achieve near human-level
performance while reducing the network size by 94% compared to the original
U-Net architecture. Given our novel application of CNNs, we generate extensive
problem-specific image data in which labeled examples are produced through a
custom interface with Amazon Mechanical Turk. This dataset contains over
375,000 labeled bee instances across 720 video frames at 2 FPS, representing an
extensive resource for the development and testing of tracking methods. We
correctly detect 96% of individuals with a location error of ~7% of a typical
body dimension, and orientation error of 12 degrees, approximating the
variability of human raters. Our results provide an important step towards
efficient image-based dense object tracking by allowing for the accurate

analyze a time series $f(t)=\sum_{k=1}^K f_k(t)$, where $f_k(t)$ is a
\emph{multiresolution intrinsic mode function} (MIMF) of the form
\begin{eqnarray*} f_k(t)&=&\sum_{n=-N/2}^{N/2-1} a_{n,k}\cos(2\pi

expansion coefficients $\{a_{n,k}\}$, $\{b_{n,k}\}$, and the shape function
series $\{s_{cn,k}(t)\}$ and $\{s_{sn,k}(t)\}$ provide innovative features for
adaptive time series analysis. The MMD aims at identifying these MIMF's

management of many chronic conditions. It is not a trivial task to understand
their impact on chronic conditions. Currently, data from electronic health
records (EHRs), sleep lab studies, and activity/sleep logs are used. The rapid
increase in the popularity of wearable health devices provides a significant
new data source, making it possible to track the user's lifestyle real-time
through web interfaces, both to consumer as well as their healthcare provider,
potentially. However, at present there is a gap between lifestyle data (e.g.,
sleep, physical activity) and clinical outcomes normally captured in EHRs. This
is a critical barrier for the use of this new source of signal for healthcare
decision making. Applying deep learning to wearables data provides a new
opportunity to overcome this barrier.
  To address the problem of the unavailability of clinical data from a major
fraction of subjects and unrepresentative subject populations, we propose a
novel unsupervised (task-agnostic) time-series representation learning
technique called act2vec. act2vec learns useful features by taking into account
the co-occurrence of activity levels along with periodicity of human activity
patterns. The learned representations are then exploited to boost the
performance of disorder-specific supervised learning models. Furthermore, since
many disorders are often related to each other, a phenomenon referred to as
co-morbidity, we use a multi-task learning framework for exploiting the shared
structure of disorder inducing life-style choices partially captured in the
wearables data. Empirical evaluation using actigraphy data from 4,124 subjects

It is not a trivial task to understand\ntheir impact on chronic conditions. Currently, data from electronic health\nrecords (EHRs), sleep lab studies, and activity/sleep logs are used. The rapid\nincrease in the popularity of wearable health devices provides a significant\nnew data source, making it possible to track the user's lifestyle real-time\nthrough web interfaces, both to consumer as well as their healthcare provider,\npotentially. However, at present there is a gap between lifestyle data (e.g.,\nsleep, physical activity) and clinical outcomes normally captured in EHRs. This\nis a critical barrier for the use of this new source of signal for healthcare\ndecision making. Applying deep learning to wearables data provides a new\nopportunity to overcome this barrier.\n  To address the problem of the unavailability of clinical data from a major\nfraction of subjects and unrepresentative subject populations, we propose a\nnovel unsupervised (task-agnostic) time-series representation learning\ntechnique called act2vec. act2vec learns useful features by taking into account\nthe co-occurrence of activity levels along with periodicity of human activity\npatterns. The learned representations are then exploited to boost the\nperformance of disorder-specific supervised learning models. Furthermore, since\nmany disorders are often related to each other, a phenomenon referred to as\nco-morbidity, we use a multi-task learning framework for exploiting the shared\nstructure of disorder inducing life-style choices partially captured in the\nwearables data. Empirical evaluation using actigraphy data from 4,124 subjects\nshows that our proposed method performs and generalizes substantially better\nthan the conventional time-series symbolic representational methods and\ntask-specific deep learning models.""}","[{'name': 'Karan Aggarwal'}, {'name': 'Shafiq Joty'}, {'name': 'Luis F.

truly a fiction! The phenomena of socioeconomic inequalities have been plaguing
mankind from times immemorial. We are interested in gaining an insight about
the co-evolution of the countries in the inequality space, from a data science
perspective. For this purpose, we use the time series data for Gini indices of
different countries, and construct the equal-time cross-correlation matrix. We
then use this to construct a similarity matrix and generate a map with the
countries as different points generated through a multi-dimensional scaling
technique. We also produce a similar map of different countries using the time
series data for Gross Domestic Savings (% of GDP). We also pose a different,
yet significant, question: Can higher savings moderate the income inequality?
In this paper, we have tried to address this question through another data
science technique - linear regression, to seek an empirical linkage between the
income inequality and savings, mainly for relatively small or closed economies.
This question was inspired from an existing theoretical model proposed by
Chakraborti-Chakrabarti (2000), based on the principle of kinetic theory of
gases. We tested our model empirically using Gini index and Gross Domestic
Savings, and observed that the model holds reasonably true for many economies

For this purpose, we use the time series data for Gini indices of\ndifferent countries, and construct the equal-time cross-correlation matrix. We\nthen use this to construct a similarity matrix and generate a map with the\ncountries as different points generated through a multi-dimensional scaling\ntechnique. We also produce a similar map of different countries using the time\nseries data for Gross Domestic Savings (% of GDP). We also pose a different,\nyet significant, question: Can higher savings moderate the income inequality?\nIn this paper, we have tried to address this question through another data\nscience technique - linear regression, to seek an empirical linkage between the\nincome inequality and savings, mainly for relatively small or closed economies.\nThis question was inspired from an existing theoretical model proposed by\nChakraborti-Chakrabarti (2000), based on the principle of kinetic theory of\ngases. We tested our model empirically using Gini index and Gross Domestic\nSavings, and observed that the model holds reasonably true for many economies\nof the world.'}","[{'name': 'Kiran Sharma'}, {'name': 'Subhradeep Das'}, {'name': 'Anirban Chakraborti'}]",{'name': 'Anirban Chakraborti'},Anirban Chakraborti,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00253v2', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.00253v2', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'q-fin.GN', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'q-fin.GN', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'physics.soc-ph', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]","8 pages, 6 figures.

{\delta} Scuti stars has no parallelism with any theoretical model.
Pre-whitening is a widespread technique in the analysis of time series with
gaps from pulsating stars located in the classical instability strip such as
{\delta} Scuti stars. However, some studies have pointed out that this
technique might introduce biases in the results of the frequency analysis. This
work aims at studying the biases that can result from pre-whitening in
asteroseismology. The results will depend on the intrinsic range and
distribution of frequencies of the stars. The periodic nature of the gaps in
CoRoT observations, just in the range of the pulsational frequency content of
the {\delta} Scuti stars, is shown to be crucial to determine their oscillation
frequencies, the first step to perform asteroseismolgy of these objects. Hence,
here we focus on the impact of pre-whitening on the asteroseismic
characterization of {\delta} Scuti stars. We select a sample of 15 {\delta}
Scuti stars observed by the CoRoT satellite, for which ultra-high quality
photometric data have been obtained by its seismic channel. In order to study
the impact on the asteroseismic characterization of {\delta} Scuti stars we
perform the pre-whitening procedure on three datasets: gapped data, linearly
interpolated data, and ARMA interpolated data. The different results obtained
show that at least in some cases pre-whitening is not an efficient procedure
for the deconvolution of the spectral window. therefore, in order to reduce the
effect of the spectral window to the minimum it is necessary to interpolate
with an algorithm that is aimed to preserve the original frequency content, and
not only to perform a pre-whitening of the data.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=6000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'It is known that the observed distribution of frequencies in CoRoT and Kepler\n{\\delta} Scuti stars has no parallelism with any theoretical model.\nPre-whitening is a widespread technique in the analysis of time series with\ngaps from pulsating stars located in the classical instability strip such as\n{\\delta} Scuti stars.

essential task for advertising companies. Challenges arise when companies run

both of these challenges. A novel Bayesian method is proposed to detect weaker
impacts and a multivariate structural time series model is used to capture the
spatial correlation between stores through placing a $\mathcal{G}$-Wishart
prior on the precision matrix. The new method is to compare two posterior
distributions of a latent variable---one obtained by using the observed data
from the test stores and the other one obtained by using the data from their
counterfactual potential outcomes. The counterfactual potential outcomes are
estimated from the data of synthetic controls, each of which is a linear
combination of sales figures at many control stores over the causal period.
Control stores are selected using a revised Expectation-Maximization variable
selection (EMVS) method. A two-stage algorithm is proposed to estimate the
parameters of the model. To prevent the prediction intervals from being
explosive, a stationarity constraint is imposed on the local linear trend of
the model through a recently proposed prior. The benefit of using this prior is

network criticality. Simulated time-series were derived from a network model of
fully connected discrete-time stochastic excitable neurons. Monofractal and
multifractal analyses were applied to neuronal gain time-series. Fractal
scaling was greatest in networks with a mid-range of neuronal plasticity,
versus extremely high or low levels of plasticity. Peak fractal scaling
corresponded closely to additional indices of criticality, including average
branching ratio. Networks exhibited multifractal structure, or multiple scaling
relationships. Multifractal spectra around peak criticality exhibited elongated
right tails, suggesting that the fractal structure is relatively insensitive to
high-amplitude local fluctuations. Networks near critical states exhibited
mid-range multifractal spectra width and tail length, which is consistent with
literature suggesting that networks poised at quasi-critical states must be
stable enough to maintain organization but unstable enough to be adaptable.
Lastly, fractal analyses may offer additional information about critical state
dynamics of networks by indicating scales of influence as networks approach
critical states.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=6000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Although there is increasing evidence of criticality in the brain, the\nprocesses that guide neuronal networks to reach or maintain criticality remain\nunclear.

theoretically, but has hardly been observed empirically. In this paper,
firstly, we find the ultraslow-like diffusion of the time-series of word counts
of already popular words by analysing three different nationwide language
databases: (i) newspaper articles (Japanese), (ii) blog articles (Japanese),
and (iii) page views of Wikipedia (English, French, Chinese, and Japanese).
Secondly, we use theoretical analysis to show that this diffusion is basically
explained by the random walk model with the power-law forgetting with the
exponent $\beta \approx 0.5$, which is related to the fractional Langevin
equation. The exponent $\beta$ characterises the speed of forgetting and $\beta
\approx 0.5$ corresponds to (i) the border (or thresholds) between the
stationary and the nonstationary and (ii) the right-in-the-middle dynamics
between the IID noise for $\beta=1$ and the normal random walk for $\beta=0$.
Thirdly, the generative model of the time-series of word counts of already
popular words, which is a kind of Poisson process with the Poisson parameter

the question arises: What is the connection of nonlinearity to the underlying
spectral properties of the flow when the nonlinear properties are related to
the associated transport mechanisms describing the geometry of the flow? The
present work is aimed at addressing this question. Based on the connection
between observed spectral and nonlinear (time series) properties of two X-ray

accretion modes of the sources in terms of known accretion classes, namely,
Keplerian disc, slim disc, advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and
general advective accretion flow (GAAF). We explore the possible transition of
the sources from one accretion mode to others with time. We further argue that
the accretion rate must play an important role in transition between these

Therefore,\nthe question arises: What is the connection of nonlinearity to the underlying\nspectral properties of the flow when the nonlinear properties are related to\nthe associated transport mechanisms describing the geometry of the flow? The\npresent work is aimed at addressing this question. Based on the connection\nbetween observed spectral and nonlinear (time series) properties of two X-ray\nbinaries: GRS 1915+105 and Sco X-1, we attempt to diagnose the underlying\naccretion modes of the sources in terms of known accretion classes, namely,\nKeplerian disc, slim disc, advection dominated accretion flow (ADAF) and\ngeneral advective accretion flow (GAAF). We explore the possible transition of\nthe sources from one accretion mode to others with time. We further argue that\nthe accretion rate must play an important role in transition between these\nmodes.'}","[{'name': 'Oluwashina Adegoke'}, {'name': 'Prasun Dhang'}, {'name': 'Banibrata Mukhopadhyay'}, {'name': 'M.

electroencephalograms (EEG). However, manual analysis of EEG data requires
highly trained clinicians, and is a procedure that is known to have relatively
low inter-rater agreement (IRA). Moreover, the volume of the data and the rate
at which new data becomes available make manual interpretation a
time-consuming, resource-hungry, and expensive process. In contrast, automated
analysis of EEG data offers the potential to improve the quality of patient
care by shortening the time to diagnosis and reducing manual error. In this

identifying whether the brain activity is abnormal or normal. To solve this

ChronoNet which is inspired by recent developments from the field of image
classification and designed to work efficiently with EEG data. ChronoNet is
formed by stacking multiple 1D convolution layers followed by deep gated
recurrent unit (GRU) layers where each 1D convolution layer uses multiple
filters of exponentially varying lengths and the stacked GRU layers are densely
connected in a feed-forward manner. We used the recently released TUH Abnormal
EEG Corpus dataset for evaluating the performance of ChronoNet. Unlike previous
studies using this dataset, ChronoNet directly takes time-series EEG as input
and learns meaningful representations of brain activity patterns. ChronoNet
outperforms the previously reported best results by 7.79% thereby setting a new
benchmark for this dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate the domain-independent
nature of ChronoNet by successfully applying it to classify speech commands.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=6000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Brain-related disorders such as epilepsy can be diagnosed by analyzing\nelectroencephalograms (EEG).

country. In combination with China's emission control and clean air
initiatives, it has resulted in large-scale expansion of the leading renewable
energy technologies, wind and solar power. Their intermittent nature and uneven
geographic distribution, however, raises the question of how to best exploit
them in a future sustainable electricity system, where their combined
production may very well exceed that of all other technologies. It is well
known that interconnecting distant regions provides more favorable production
patterns from wind and solar. On the other hand, long-distance connections
challenge traditional local energy autonomy. In this paper, the advantage of
interconnecting the contiguous provinces of China is quantified. To this end,
two different methodologies are introduced. The first aims at gradually
increasing heterogeneity, that is non-local wind and solar power production, to
minimize production costs without regard to the match between production and
demand. The second method optimizes the trade-off between low cost production
and high utility value of the energy. In both cases, the study of a 100%
renewable Chinese electricity network is based on 8 years of high-resolution
hourly time series of wind and solar power generation and electricity demand
for each of the provinces. From the study we conclude that compared to a
baseline design of homogeneously distributed renewable capacities, a
heterogeneous network not only lowers capital investments but also reduces
backup dispatches from thermal units. Installing more capacity in provinces
like Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Hainan and north-western regions, heterogeneous
layouts may lower the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) by up to 27%, and

Dictionary learning approaches have been widely used for tasks such as
low-level signal denoising and restoration as well as high-level classification
tasks, which can be applied to audio and image analysis. Synthesis dictionary
learning aims at jointly learning a dictionary and corresponding sparse
coefficients to provide accurate data representation. This approach is useful
for denoising and signal restoration, but may lead to sub-optimal
classification performance. By contrast, analysis dictionary learning provides
a transform that maps data to a sparse discriminative representation suitable
for classification. We consider the problem of analysis dictionary learning for
time-series data under a weak supervision setting in which signals are assigned
with a global label instead of an instantaneous label signal. We propose a
discriminative probabilistic model that incorporates both label information and
sparsity constraints on the underlying latent instantaneous label signal using
cardinality control. We present the expectation maximization (EM) procedure for
maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the proposed model. To facilitate a
computationally efficient E-step, we propose both a chain and a novel tree

health care, and in particular multi-channel Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a
highly prevalent diagnostic modality that relies on robust sequence modeling.
While Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have led to significant advances in
automated diagnosis with time-series data, they perform poorly when models are
trained using a limited set of channels. A crucial limitation of existing
solutions is that they rely solely on discriminative models, which tend to
generalize poorly in such scenarios. In order to combat this limitation, we
develop a generative modeling approach to limited channel ECG classification.
This approach first uses a Seq2Seq model to implicitly generate the missing
channel information, and then uses the latent representation to perform the
actual supervisory task. This decoupling enables the use of unsupervised data

interplanetary space weather forecasting models with accurate time dependent
boundary conditions of erupting magnetic flux ropes in the upper solar corona.
To produce boundary conditions, we couple two different modelling techniques,
MHD simulations and a quasi-static non-potential evolution model. Both are
applied on a spatial domain that covers the entire solar surface. The
non-potential model uses a time series of observed synoptic magnetograms to
drive the non-potential quasi-static evolution of the coronal magnetic field.
This allows us to follow the formation and loss of equilibrium of magnetic flux
ropes. Following this a MHD simulation captures the dynamic evolution of the
erupting flux rope. The present paper focuses on the MHD simulations that
follow the ejection of magnetic flux ropes to 4$R_\odot$. We first propose a
technique for specifying the pre-eruptive plasma properties in the corona.
Next, time dependent MHD simulations describe the ejection of two magnetic flux
ropes, that produce time dependent boundary conditions for the magnetic field
and plasma at 4$R_{\odot}$. In the present paper, we show that the dual use of
quasi-static non-potential magnetic field simulations and full time dependent

potentially habitable planets. K2-3 is a nearby (45 pc), early-type M dwarf
hosting three small transiting planets, the outermost of which orbits close to
the inner edge of the stellar (optimistic) habitable zone. The K2-3 system is
well suited for follow-up characterization studies aimed at determining
accurate masses and bulk densities of the three planets. Using a total of 329
radial velocity measurements collected over 2.5 years with the HARPS-N and
HARPS spectrographs and a proper treatment of the stellar activity signal, we
aim to improve measurements of the masses and bulk densities of the K2-3
planets. We use our results to investigate the physical structure of the
planets. We analyse radial velocity time series extracted with two independent
pipelines by using Gaussian process regression. We adopt a quasi-periodic
kernel to model the stellar magnetic activity jointly with the planetary
signals. We use Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the robustness of our
mass measurements of K2-3\,c and K2-3\,d, and to explore how additional
high-cadence radial velocity observations might improve them. Despite the
stellar activity component being the strongest signal present in the radial
velocity time series, we are able to derive masses for both planet b ($M_{\rm
b}=6.6\pm1.1$ $M_{\rm \oplus}$) and planet c ($M_{\rm c}=3.1^{+1.3}_{-1.2}$
$M_{\rm \oplus}$). The Doppler signal due to K2-3\,d remains undetected, likely
because of its low amplitude compared to the radial velocity signal induced by
the stellar activity. The closeness of the orbital period of K2-3\,d to the

the observed time series into a matrix, utilizing matrix estimation to recover
missing values and de-noise observed entries, and performing linear regression
to make predictions. At the core of our analysis is a representation result,
which states that for a large model class, the transformed time series matrix
is (approximately) low-rank. In effect, this generalizes the widely used
Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) in time series literature, and allows us to
establish a rigorous link between time series analysis and matrix estimation.
The key to establishing this link is constructing a Page matrix with
non-overlapping entries rather than a Hankel matrix as is commonly done in the
literature (e.g., SSA). This particular matrix structure allows us to provide
finite sample analysis for imputation and prediction, and prove the asymptotic
consistency of our method. Another salient feature of our algorithm is that it
is model agnostic with respect to both the underlying time dynamics and the
noise distribution in the observations. The noise agnostic property of our
approach allows us to recover the latent states when only given access to noisy
and partial observations a la a Hidden Markov Model; e.g., recovering the
time-varying parameter of a Poisson process without knowing that the underlying
process is Poisson. Furthermore, since our forecasting algorithm requires
regression with noisy features, our approach suggests a matrix estimation based
method - coupled with a novel, non-standard matrix estimation error metric - to
solve the error-in-variable regression problem, which could be of interest in
its own right. Through synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that
our algorithm outperforms standard software packages (including R libraries) in

chromospheres leave a dramatic imprint in the intensity profile of the Ca II

polarization profiles, that show even more dramatic variations during the
passage of these shock fronts. While most of these variations can be explained
with an almost constant magnetic field as a function of time, several studies
have reported changes in the inferred magnetic field strength during UF phases.
In this study we investigate the origin of these periodic variations of the
magnetic field strength by analyzing a time-series of high temporal cadence
observations acquired in the Ca II line with the CRISP instrument at the
Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. In particular, we analyze how the inferred
geometrical height scale changes between quiescent and UF phases, and whether
those changes are enough to explain the observed changes in $B$. We have
performed non-LTE data inversions with the NICOLE code of a time-series of very
high spatio-temporal resolution observations in the Ca II and Fe I
630.15\630.25 nm lines. Our results indicate that the Ca II line in sunspots is
greatly sensitive to magnetic fields at $\log\tau_{500}=-5$ during UFs and
quiescence. However, this optical depth value does not correspond to the same
geometrical height during the two phases. Our results indicate that during UFs
and RPWs the $\log\tau=-5$ is located at a higher geometrical height than
during quiescence. Additionally, the inferred magnetic field values are higher
in UFs (~270 G) and in RPWs (~100 G). Our results suggest that opacity changes
caused by UFs and RPWs cannot explain the observed temporal variations in the

the field is expected to be lower.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=6000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Umbral flashes (UF) and running penumbral waves (RPWs) in sunspot\nchromospheres leave a dramatic imprint in the intensity profile of the Ca II\n854.2 nm line.

this, we formalize the original Altes waveforms as a family of hyperbolic

demand for a stock, as revealed through the order book, to subsequent
variations in its market price. We assess the model by testing its
out-of-sample predictions for the direction of price moves given the history of
price and order flow, across a wide range of stocks and time periods. The
universal price formation model is shown to exhibit a remarkably stable
out-of-sample prediction accuracy across time, for a wide range of stocks from
different sectors. Interestingly, these results also hold for stocks which are
not part of the training sample, showing that the relations captured by the
model are universal and not asset-specific.
  The universal model --- trained on data from all stocks --- outperforms, in
terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy, asset-specific linear and nonlinear
models trained on time series of any given stock, showing that the universal
nature of price formation weighs in favour of pooling together financial data
from various stocks, rather than designing asset- or sector-specific models as
commonly done. Standard data normalizations based on volatility, price level or
average spread, or partitioning the training data into sectors or categories

Reservoir Computing (RC) provides efficient tools to generate a vectorial,

classifiers. Despite their unrivaled training speed, MTS classifiers based on a
standard RC architecture fail to achieve the same accuracy of fully trainable
neural networks. In this paper we introduce the reservoir model space, an
unsupervised approach based on RC to learn vectorial representations of MTS.
Each MTS is encoded within the parameters of a linear model trained to predict
a low-dimensional embedding of the reservoir dynamics. Compared to other RC
methods, our model space yields better representations and attains comparable
computational performance, thanks to an intermediate dimensionality reduction
procedure. As a second contribution we propose a modular RC framework for MTS
classification, with an associated open-source Python library. The framework
provides different modules to seamlessly implement advanced RC architectures.
The architectures are compared to other MTS classifiers, including deep
learning models and time series kernels. Results obtained on benchmark and
real-world MTS datasets show that RC classifiers are dramatically faster and,

In this paper we introduce the reservoir model space, an\nunsupervised approach based on RC to learn vectorial representations of MTS.\nEach MTS is encoded within the parameters of a linear model trained to predict\na low-dimensional embedding of the reservoir dynamics. Compared to other RC\nmethods, our model space yields better representations and attains comparable\ncomputational performance, thanks to an intermediate dimensionality reduction\nprocedure. As a second contribution we propose a modular RC framework for MTS\nclassification, with an associated open-source Python library. The framework\nprovides different modules to seamlessly implement advanced RC architectures.\nThe architectures are compared to other MTS classifiers, including deep\nlearning models and time series kernels.

deconvolve resting state fMRI data. To validate the method, we evaluate the

predictive uncertainty and describe rich multimodal, non-Gaussian behaviour,

We prove this problem to be NP-hard and additionally show that a\nrecent dynamic programming algorithm is essentially optimal. In this context,\nwe study a broad family of circular string alignment problems. This family also\nserves as a key for our hardness reductions, and it is of independent\n(practical) interest in molecular biology. In particular, we show tight\nhardness and running time lower bounds for Circular Consensus String; notably,\nthe corresponding non-circular version is easily linear-time solvable.'}","[{'name': 'Laurent Bulteau'}, {'name': 'Vincent Froese'}, {'name': 'Rolf Niedermeier'}]",{'name': 'Rolf Niedermeier'},Rolf Niedermeier,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02854v4', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.02854v4', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.DM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.DM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.DS', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,

Our work\nestablishes a new connection between thermodynamic phase transitions and\nbifurcations in low-dimensional dynamical systems, and opens new avenues to\nidentify the nature of dynamical shifts in systems for which only short time\nseries are available.'}","[{'name': 'Alvaro Corral'}, {'name': 'Lluis Alseda'}, {'name': 'Josep Sardanyes'}]",{'name': 'Josep Sardanyes'},Josep Sardanyes,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03711v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.03711v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'nlin.AO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'nlin.AO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,
