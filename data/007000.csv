short orbital periods and low mass ratios. A previous detection of short-term
oscillations in its light curve has not yet been confirmed. We investigate a
new time series of high-resolution spectra with the aim to derive improved
stellar and system parameters, to search for the possible impact of a third
component in the observed spectra, to look for indications of activity in the
Algol system, and to search for short-term variations in radial velocities. We
disentangled the composite spectra into the spectra of the binary components.
Then we analysed the resulting high signal-to-noise spectra of both stars.
Using a newly developed program code based on an improved method of
least-squares deconvolution, we were able to determine the radial velocities of
both components also during primary eclipse. This allowed us to develop a
better model of the system including the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect and to
derive improved orbital parameters. Combining the results with those from
spectrum analysis, we obtain accurate stellar and system parameters. We further
deduce at least one oscillation frequency of 21.38 c/d. It could be detected

Owing to the wavelength used, and the size and the distance of the asteroid, a
diffraction pattern in the Fraunhofer regime was observed. The measurement
retrieves both the amplitude and the phase of the diffracted electromagnetic
wave. This is the first astronomical measurement of the phase shift caused by
diffraction. The maximum phase shift is sensitive to the effective diameter of
the asteroid. The bright spot at the shadow's center, the so called
Arago--Poisson spot, is clearly detected in the amplitude time-series, and its
strength is a good indicator of the closest angular distance between the center
of the asteroid and the radio source. A sample of random shapes constructed
using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm suggests that the silhouette of

product of localized, equator-ward landsliding from the surface of an asteroid
rotating at the brink of instability. We obtained new Hubble Space Telescope
observations to directly measure the nucleus and to search for evidence of its
rapid rotation. However, instead of providing photometric evidence for rapid
nucleus rotation, our data set a lower limit to the lightcurve period, $P \ge$
5.4 hour. The dominant feature of the lightcurve is a V-shaped minimum,
$\sim$0.3 magnitudes deep, that is suggestive of an eclipsing binary. Under
this interpretation, the time-series data are consistent with a
secondary/primary mass ratio, $m_s/m_p \sim$ 1:6, a ratio of separation/primary
radius, $r/r_p \sim$ 4 and an orbit period $\sim$0.8 days. These properties lie
within the range of other asteroid binaries that are thought to be formed by
rotational breakup. While the lightcurve period is long, centripetal dust
ejection is still possible if one or both components rotates rapidly
($\lesssim$ 2 hour) and has a small lightcurve variation because of azimuthal
symmetry. Indeed, radar observations of asteroids in critical rotation reveal
""muffin-shaped"" morphologies which are closely azimuthally symmetric and which
show minimal lightcurves. Our data are consistent with 311P being a close
binary in which one or both components rotates near the centripetal limit. The
mass loss in 2013 suggests that breakup occurred recently and could even be

decrease (drawdowns). In combination with the Lagrange Regularisation Method

and 10 additional smaller peaks, that have punctuated the dynamics of Bitcoin
price during the analyzed time period. We explain this classification of long
and short bubbles by a number of quantitative metrics and graphs to understand
the main socio-economic drivers behind the ascent of Bitcoin over this period.
Then, a detailed analysis of the growing risks associated with the three long
bubbles using the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model is based on
the LPPLS Confidence Indicators, defined as the fraction of qualified fits of
the LPPLS model over multiple time windows. Furthermore, for various fictitious
'present' times $t_2$ before the crashes, we employ a clustering method to
group the predicted critical times $t_c$ of the LPPLS fits over different time
scales, where $t_c$ is the most probable time for the ending of the bubble.
Each cluster is proposed as a plausible scenario for the subsequent Bitcoin
price evolution. We present these predictions for the three long bubbles and
the four short bubbles that our time scale of analysis was able to resolve.

We explain this classification of long\nand short bubbles by a number of quantitative metrics and graphs to understand\nthe main socio-economic drivers behind the ascent of Bitcoin over this period.\nThen, a detailed analysis of the growing risks associated with the three long\nbubbles using the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model is based on\nthe LPPLS Confidence Indicators, defined as the fraction of qualified fits of\nthe LPPLS model over multiple time windows. Furthermore, for various fictitious\n'present' times $t_2$ before the crashes, we employ a clustering method to\ngroup the predicted critical times $t_c$ of the LPPLS fits over different time\nscales, where $t_c$ is the most probable time for the ending of the bubble.\nEach cluster is proposed as a plausible scenario for the subsequent Bitcoin\nprice evolution. We present these predictions for the three long bubbles and\nthe four short bubbles that our time scale of analysis was able to resolve.\nOverall, our predictive scheme provides useful information to warn of an\nimminent crash risk.""}","[{'name': 'Jan-Christian Gerlach'}, {'name': 'Guilherme Demos'}, {'name': 'Didier Sornette'}]",{'name': 'Didier Sornette'},Didier Sornette,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06261v4', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.06261v4', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'econ.EM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'econ.EM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'q-fin.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,

Here we
show that the interhemispheric contrast in Atlantic SST (ICAS) drives African
dust variability on interannual, multidecadal, and millennial timescales, and a
strong anthropogenic decline of African dust in the future can be expected due
to the projected increase of the ICAS. During the recent past, the ICAS is
found to significantly correlate with various dust observations and proxies
that extend as far back as 1851. Physically, positive ICAS anomalies induce
large-scale circulation changes that push the Intertropical Convergence Zone
(ITCZ) northward and decrease surface wind speed over African dust source
regions, which reduces dust emission and transport to the tropical Atlantic.
The ICAS-ITCZ-dust relationship also finds robust support from paleo-climate
observations that span the last 17,000 years. The ICAS drive of African dust
variability is consistent with documented relationships between dust activity
and Sahel precipitation6, the North Atlantic Oscillation7, and time series of a
surface wind speed pattern over Northern Africa8, and offers a unified
framework to understand them. The ICAS-dust connection implies that human
activities that change ICAS through emitting greenhouse gases and pollutions
have affected and will continue to affect African dust. Climate models project
that anthropogenic increase of the ICAS can push the ICAS value to surpass the
highest level attained during the Holocene by the end of this century and
decrease African dust activity by as much as 60% off its current level, which

the exponential behavior at each pixel, along with the spatial smoothness of
the exponential parameters, can be exploited to derive a 3D annihilation

provide useful but not necessarily complete samples of candidates.
  The processed Gaia data consist of the G, BP, and RP photometry during the
first 22 months of operations as well as positions and parallaxes. Various
methods from classical statistics, data mining and time series analysis were
applied and tailored to the specific properties of Gaia data, as well as
various visualisation tools.
  The DR2 variability release contains: 228'904 RR Lyrae stars, 11'438
Cepheids, 151'761 LPVs, 147'535 stars with rotation modulation, 8'882 delta
Scuti & SX Phoenicis stars, and 3'018 short-timescale variables. These results
are distributed over a classification and various Specific Object Studies (SOS)
tables in the Gaia archive, along with the three-band time series and
associated statistics for the underlying 550'737 unique sources. We estimate
that about half of them are newly identified variables. The variability type
completeness varies strongly as function of sky position due to the non-uniform
sky coverage and intermediate calibration level of this data. The probabilistic
and automated nature of this work implies certain completeness and
contamination rates which are quantified so that users can anticipate their
effects. This means that even well-known variable sources can be missed or
misidentified in the published data.

solving complex inverse problems. The aim of this work is to develop a novel
CNN framework to reconstruct video sequence of dynamic live cells captured
using a computational microscopy technique, Fourier ptychographic microscopy
(FPM). The unique feature of the FPM is its capability to reconstruct images
with both wide field-of-view (FOV) and high resolution, i.e. a large
space-bandwidth-product (SBP), by taking a series of low resolution intensity
images. For live cell imaging, a single FPM frame contains thousands of cell
samples with different morphological features. Our idea is to fully exploit the
statistical information provided by this large spatial ensemble so as to make
predictions in a sequential measurement, without using any additional temporal
dataset. Specifically, we show that it is possible to reconstruct high-SBP
dynamic cell videos by a CNN trained only on the first FPM dataset captured at
the beginning of a time-series experiment. Our CNN approach reconstructs a
12800X10800 pixels phase image using only ~25 seconds, a 50X speedup compared
to the model-based FPM algorithm. In addition, the CNN further reduces the
required number of images in each time frame by ~6X. Overall, this
significantly improves the imaging throughput by reducing both the acquisition
and computational times. The proposed CNN is based on the conditional
generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework. Additionally, we also exploit
transfer learning so that our pre-trained CNN can be further optimized to image
other cell types. Our technique demonstrates a promising deep learning approach

Here, it is found that the featured direction choices could be inspired by the
shape characteristics of Voronoi diagram. To be specific, in the Voronoi cell
of a pedestrian, the direction to a Voronoi node is regarded as a potential
""detour"" direction, and the direction perpendicular to a Voronoi link is
regarded as a potential ""following"" direction. A pedestrian generally owns
several alternative Voronoi nodes and Voronoi links in a Voronoi cell, and the
optimal detour and following direction are determined by considering related
factors such as deviation. Plus the destination direction which is directly
pointing to the destination, the three basic direction choices are defined in a
Voronoi cell. In order to evaluate the Voronoi diagram based basic directions,
the empirical trajectory data in both uni- and bi-directional flow experiments
are extracted. A time series method considering the step frequency is used to
reduce the original trajectories' swaying phenomena which might disturb the
recognition of actual forward direction. The deviations between the empirical
velocity direction and the basic directions are investigated, and each velocity
direction is classified into a basic direction or regarded as an inexplicable
direction according to the deviations. The analysis results show that each
basic direction could be a potential direction choice for a pedestrian. The

is not possible. Included in our 13 dimensions are four parameters which
describe the coefficients of a cubic polynomial attached to a Gaussian picking
up a general trend, four parameters picking up periodicity in a time series,

which 151'761 are long-period variable (LPV) candidates with G variability
amplitudes larger than 0.2 mag (5-95% quantile range). About one-fifth of the
LPV candidates are Mira candidates, the majority of the rest are semi-regular
variable candidates. For each source, G, BP , and RP photometric time-series
are published, together with some LPV-specific attributes for the subset of
89'617 candidates with periods in G longer than 60 days. We describe this first
Gaia catalogue of LPV candidates, and present various validation checks.
Various samples of LPVs were used to validate the catalogue: a sample of
well-studied very bright LPVs with light curves from the AAVSO that are partly
contemporaneous with Gaia light curves, a sample of Gaia LPV candidates with
good parallaxes, the ASAS_SN catalogue of LPVs, and the OGLE catalogues of LPVs
towards the Magellanic Clouds and the Galactic bulge. The analyses of these
samples show a good agreement between Gaia DR2 and literature periods. The same
is globally true for bolometric corrections of M-type stars. The main
contaminant of our DR2 catalogue comes from young stellar objects (YSOs) in the
solar vicinity (within ~1 kpc), although their number in the whole catalogue is
only at the percent level. A cautionary note is provided about
parallax-dependent LPV attributes published in the catalogue. This first Gaia
catalogue of LPVs approximately doubles the number of known LPVs with
amplitudes larger than 0.2 mag, despite the conservative candidate selection
criteria that prioritise low contamination over high completeness, and despite
the limited DR2 time coverage compared to the long periods characteristic of
LPVs. It also contains a small set of YSO candidates, which offers the
serendipitous opportunity to study these objects at an early stage of the Gaia

are analyzed based on 12 bands of NIR to MIR co-added data from 2MASS, Spitzer
and WISE, and $\sim$6.6 years of MIR time-series data collected by the ALLWISE
and NEOWISE-R projects. 773 RSGs candidates were compiled from the literature
and verified by using the CMD, SED and MIR variability. About 15\% of valid
targets in the $IRAC1-IRAC2$/$IRAC2-IRAC3$ diagram may show PAH emission. We
show that arbitrary dereddening Q parameters related to the IRAC4, S9W, WISE3,
WISE4, and MIPS24 bands could be constructed based on a precise measurement of
MIR interstellar extinction law. Several peculiar outliers in our sample are
discussed, in which one outlier might be a RSG right before the explosion or an
x-AGB star in the very late evolutionary stage based on the MIR spectrum and
photometry. There are 744 identified RSGs in the final sample having both the
WISE1- and WISE2-band time-series data. The results show that the MIR
variability is increasing along with the increasing of brightness. There is a
relatively tight correlation between the MIR variability, MLR, and the warm
dust or continuum, where the MIR variability is evident for the targets with
$K_S-WISE3>1.0~mag$ and $WISE4<6.5~mag$, while the rest of the targets show
much smaller MIR variability. The MIR variability is also correlated with the
MLR for which targets with larger variability also show larger MLR with an
approximate upper limit of $-6.1~M_\odot/yr^{-1}$. Both the variability and the
luminosity may be important for the MLR since the WISE4-band flux is increasing
exponentially along with the degeneracy of luminosity and variability. The
identified RSG sample has been compared with the theoretical evolutionary
models and shown that the discrepancy between observation and evolutionary
models can be mitigated by considering both variability and extinction.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=7000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The characteristics of IR properties and MIR variability of RSGs in the LMC\nare analyzed based on 12 bands of NIR to MIR co-added data from 2MASS, Spitzer\nand WISE, and $\\sim$6.6 years of MIR time-series data collected by the ALLWISE\nand NEOWISE-R projects. 773 RSGs candidates were compiled from the literature\nand verified by using the CMD, SED and MIR variability.

computation for models involving structural changes. Our aim is to review
developments as they relate to econometric applications based on linear models.
Substantial advances have been made to cover models at a level of generality
that allow a host of interesting practical applications. These include models
with general stationary regressors and errors that can exhibit temporal
dependence and heteroskedasticity, models with trending variables and possible
unit roots and cointegrated models, among others. Advances have been made
pertaining to computational aspects of constructing estimates, their limit
distributions, tests for structural changes, and methods to determine the
number of changes present. A variety of topics are covered. The first part
summarizes and updates developments described in an earlier review, Perron
(2006), with the exposition following heavily that of Perron (2008). Additions
are included for recent developments: testing for common breaks, models with
endogenous regressors (emphasizing that simply using least-squares is
preferable over instrumental variables methods), quantile regressions, methods
based on Lasso, panel data models, testing for changes in forecast accuracy,
factors models and methods of inference based on a continuous records
asymptotic framework. Our focus is on the so-called off-line methods whereby
one wants to retrospectively test for breaks in a given sample of data and form
confidence intervals about the break dates. The aim is to provide the readers
with an overview of methods that are of direct usefulness in practice as

oxygen-rich Mira star R Peg. We used K band spectro-interferometry with a
spectral resolution of about 4000 obtained at four epochs between post-maximum
and minimum visual phases employing the newly available GRAVITY beam combiner
at the VLTI. Our observations show a continuum radius that is anti-correlated
with the visual lightcurve. Uniform disc (UD) angular diameters at a
near-continuum wavelength of 2.25 mu are steadily increasing with values of 8.7
mas, 9.4 mas, 9.8 mas, and 9.9 mas at visual phases of 0.15, 0.36, 0,45, 0.53,
respectively. UD diameters at a bandpass around 2.05 mu, dominated by water
vapour, follow the near-continuum variability at larger UD diameters. UD
diameters at the CO 2-0 bandhead, instead, are correlated with the visual
lightcurve and anti-correlated with the near-continuum UD diameters. The
observed anti-correlation between continuum radius and visual lightcurve is
consistent with an earlier study of the oxygen-rich Mira S Lac, and with recent
1D CODEX dynamic model atmosphere predictions. The amplitude of the variation
is comparable to the earlier observations of S Lac, and smaller than predicted
by CODEX models. The wavelength-dependent visibility variations at our epochs
can be reproduced by a set of CODEX models at model phases between 0.3 and 0.6.
The anti-correlation of water vapour and CO contributions at our epochs
suggests that these molecules undergo different processes along the stellar
cycle. The newly available GRAVITY instrument is suited to conducting longer

variations were established in most stars: outbursts on different time-scales

on intermediate time-scales (1$\pm$1%) and short-term periodic variations
(6$\pm$3%). 24$\pm$6% of the outbursting stars exhibit (semi)periodic

measured rising and falling times for well-covered and well-defined outbursts.
Nearly all outburst events are characterized by falling times that exceed the

The nature of the recently identified ""sdA"" spectroscopic class of
star is not well understood. The thousands of known sdAs have H-dominated
spectra, spectroscopic surface gravities intermediate to main sequence stars
and isolated white dwarfs, and effective temperatures below the lower limit for
He-burning subdwarfs. Most are likely products of binary stellar evolution,
whether extremely low-mass white dwarfs and their precursors, or blue
stragglers in the halo.
  Aims. Stellar eigenfrequencies revealed through time series photometry of
pulsating stars sensitively probe stellar structural properties. The properties
of pulsations exhibited by any sdA stars would contribute importantly to our
developing understanding of this class.
  Methods. We extend our photometric campaign to discover pulsating extremely
low-mass white dwarfs from McDonald Observatory to target sdA stars classified
from SDSS spectra. We also obtain follow-up time series spectroscopy to search
for binary signatures from four new pulsators.
  Results. Out of 23 sdA stars observed, we clearly detect stellar pulsations
in seven. Dominant pulsation periods range from 4.6 minutes to 12.3 hours, with
most on ~hour timescales. We argue specific classifications for some of the new
variables, identifying both compact and likely main sequence dwarf pulsators,
along with a candidate low-mass RR Lyrae star.
  Conclusions. With dominant pulsation periods spanning orders of magnitude,
the pulsational evidence supports the emerging narrative that the sdA class
consists of multiple stellar populations. Since multiple types of sdA exhibit
stellar pulsations, follow-up asteroseismic analysis can be used to probe the
precise evolutionary natures and stellar structures of these individual
subpopulations.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=7000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Context.

Most are likely products of binary stellar evolution,\nwhether extremely low-mass white dwarfs and their precursors, or blue\nstragglers in the halo.\n  Aims. Stellar eigenfrequencies revealed through time series photometry of\npulsating stars sensitively probe stellar structural properties. The properties\nof pulsations exhibited by any sdA stars would contribute importantly to our\ndeveloping understanding of this class.\n  Methods. We extend our photometric campaign to discover pulsating extremely\nlow-mass white dwarfs from McDonald Observatory to target sdA stars classified\nfrom SDSS spectra. We also obtain follow-up time series spectroscopy to search\nfor binary signatures from four new pulsators.\n  Results. Out of 23 sdA stars observed, we clearly detect stellar pulsations\nin seven. Dominant pulsation periods range from 4.6 minutes to 12.3 hours, with\nmost on ~hour timescales. We argue specific classifications for some of the new\nvariables, identifying both compact and likely main sequence dwarf pulsators,\nalong with a candidate low-mass RR Lyrae star.\n  Conclusions. With dominant pulsation periods spanning orders of magnitude,\nthe pulsational evidence supports the emerging narrative that the sdA class\nconsists of multiple stellar populations. Since multiple types of sdA exhibit\nstellar pulsations, follow-up asteroseismic analysis can be used to probe the\nprecise evolutionary natures and stellar structures of these individual\nsubpopulations.'}","[{'name': 'Keaton J.

the presence of fat-tailed symmetric and asymmetric probability distributions
of fluctuations in time series. In the presented approach different kinds of
symmetric and asymmetric broad probability distributions of synthetic data are
examined starting from Levy regime up to those with finite variance. We use
nonextensive Tsallis statistics to construct all considered data in order to
have good analytical description of frequencies of fluctuations in the whole
range of their magnitude and simultaneously the full control over exponent of
power-law decay for tails of probability distribution. The semi-analytical
compact formulas are then provided to express the level of spurious
multifractality generated by the presence of fat tails in terms of Tsallis
parameter $\tilde{q}$ and the scaling exponent $\beta$ of the asymptotic decay
of cumulated probability density function (CDF).The results are presented in
Hurst and H\""{o}lder languages - more often used in study of multifractal
phenomena. According to the provided semi-analytical relations, it is argued
how one can make a clear quantitative distinction for any real data between
true multifractality caused by the presence of nonlinear correlations, spurious
multifractality generated by fat-tailed shape of distributions - eventually
with their asymmetry, and the correction due to linear autocorrelations in
analyzed time series of finite length. In particular, the spurious multifractal

of nonlinear data. We present a novel tool for time series analysis that
identifies nonlinearities by sensitively detecting correlations among the
Fourier phases. The method, being called phase walk analysis, is based on well
established measures from random walk analysis, which are now applied to the
unwrapped Fourier phases of time series. We provide an analytical description
of its functionality and demonstrate its capabilities on systematically
controlled leptokurtic noise. Hereby, we investigate the properties of
leptokurtic time series and their influence on the Fourier phases of time
series. The phase walk analysis is applied to measured and simulated
intermittent time series, whose probability density distribution are
approximated by power laws. We use the day-to-day returns of the Dow-Jones
industrial average, a synthetic time series with tailored nonlinearities

To give a best guess on the large separation of modes in\nthe power spectrum, we have applied a new method which uses the scaling of\nKepler red-giant stars to 46 LMi.\n  Several methods have been applied: classical estimates, seismic methods using\nthe observed time series, and model calculations to derive the fundamental\nparameters of 46 LMi. Parameters determined using the different methods are\nconsistent within the uncertainties.

clustering performance even further and provides additional explanatory

and temporally limited, and thus they are often unable to quantify the full
extent of extreme flood events. Moreover, only missions with a short-repeat
orbit, such as Envisat, Jason-2, or SARAL, could provide meaningful time series
of water level variations directly. However, long or non-repeat orbit missions
such as CryoSat-2 have a very dense spatial resolution under the trade-off of a
repeat time insufficient for time series extraction. Combining data from
multiple altimeter missions into a multi-mission product allows for increasing
the spatial and temporal resolution of the data. In this study, we combined
water level data from CryoSat-2 with various observations from other altimeter
missions in the Mekong River Basin between 2008 and 2016 into one multi-mission

behaviour and the extreme floodings in 2008 and 2011. It performs better than
single-mission time series or multi-mission time series based only on

Performance of our framework across ground\ntruth data over real-world forecasting tasks shows that our methods yield a\nsignificant lift or increase of F1 for the top signals on predicted cyber\nattacks. Our results suggest that, when deployed, our system will be able to\nprovide an effective line of defense against various types of targeted cyber\nattacks.'}","[{'name': 'Palash Goyal'}, {'name': 'KSM Tozammel Hossain'}, {'name': 'Ashok Deb'}, {'name': 'Nazgol Tavabi'}, {'name': 'Nathan Bartley'}, {'name': ""Andr'es Abeliuk""}, {'name': 'Emilio Ferrara'}, {'name': 'Kristina Lerman'}]",{'name': 'Kristina Lerman'},Kristina Lerman,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03342v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.03342v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'cs.SI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.SI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,

Considering the\neffective role of capital in the agricultural low productivity, we suggest\napplying productivity management plans (especially in regards of capital\nproductivity) to achieve future growth goals.""}","[{'name': 'Morteza Tahamipour'}, {'name': 'Mina Mahmoudi'}]",{'name': 'Mina Mahmoudi'},Mina Mahmoudi,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1806.04235v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04235v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'econ.EM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'econ.EM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]","Research in Applied Economics (2018), Vol 10, No 1",

populations of intrinsically faint objects using microlensing technique. Large

strategies affect the number and properties of microlensing events detected by
LSST. We predict that LSST will mostly observe long duration microlensing
events due to the source stars with the averaged magnitude around 22 in r-band,
rather than high-magnification events due to fainter source stars. In Galactic
bulge fields, LSST should detect on the order of 400 microlensing events per
square degree as compared to 15 in disk fields. Improving the cadence increases
the number of detectable microlensing events, e.g., improving the cadence from
6 to 2 days approximately doubles the number of microlensing events throughout
the Galaxy. According to the current LSST strategy, it will observe some fields
900 times during a 10-year survey with the average cadence of ~4-days (I) and
other fields (mostly toward the Galactic disk) around 180 times during a 1-year

of events corresponding to these strategies are 7900 and 34000, respectively.

detect more and on average longer microlensing events than those observable

thoracic radiation therapy. Hybrid magnetic resonance-guided radiotherapy
systems have the potential to control for intrafraction motion. Recently, we
introduced an MRI sequence capable of acquiring real-time cine imaging in two
orthogonal planes (SOPI). We extend SOPI here to permit dynamic updating of
slice positions in one plane while keeping the other plane position fixed. In
this implementation, cine images from the static plane are used for motion
monitoring and as image navigators to sort stepped images in the other plane,
producing dynamic 4D image volumes for use in dose reconstruction. A custom
3D-printed target filled with radiochromic FXG gel was interfaced to a dynamic
motion phantom. 4D-SOPI was acquired in a dynamic motion phantom driven by an
actual patient respiratory waveform displaying amplitude/frequency variations
and drifting and in a healthy volunteer. Unique 4D-MRI epochs were
reconstructed from a time series of phantom motion. Dose from a static 4cmx15cm
field was calculated on each 4D respiratory phase bin and epoch image, scaled
by the time spent in each bin, and then rigidly accumulated. The phantom was

with age, but it is widely debated in the literature whether there is a smooth
decline or if there is an early sharp drop until 1-2 Gyr followed by a
relatively inactive constant phase. We revisited the activity-age relation
using time-series observations of a large sample of solar twins whose precise
isochronal ages and other important physical parameters have been determined.
We measured the Ca II H and K activity indices using 9000 HARPS spectra of 82
solar twins. We measured an average solar activity of $S_{\rm MW}$ = 0.1712
$\pm$ 0.0017 during solar magnetic cycles 23$-$24 covered by HARPS observations
and we also inferred an average of $S_{\rm MW}$ = 0.1694 $\pm$ 0.0025 for
cycles 10$-$24, anchored on a S index vs. sunspot number correlation. Also, a
simple relation between the average and dispersion of the activity levels of
solar twins was found. This enabled us to predict the stellar variability
effects on the age-activity diagram and, consequently, estimate the
chromospheric age uncertainties due to the same phenomena. The age-activity
relation is still statistically significant up to ages around 6$-$7 Gyr, in
agreement with previous works using open clusters and field stars with precise
ages. Our research confirms that Ca II H \& K lines remain a useful
chromospheric evolution tracer until stars reach ages of at least 6$-$7 Gyr. We
found an evidence that, for the most homogeneous set of old stars, the
chromospheric activity indices seem to continue decreasing after the solar age
towards the end of the main-sequence. Our results indicate that a significant
part of the scatter observed in the age-activity relation of solar twins can be

multilevel Wavelet Decomposition Network (mWDN) for building frequency-aware
deep learning models for time series analysis. mWDN preserves the advantage of
multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition in frequency learning while enables
the fine-tuning of all parameters under a deep neural network framework. Based

Classification Flow (RCF) and multi-frequecy Long Short-Term Memory (mLSTM) for
time series classification and forecasting, respectively. The two models take
all or partial mWDN decomposed sub-series in different frequencies as input,
and resort to the back propagation algorithm to learn all the parameters
globally, which enables seamless embedding of wavelet-based frequency analysis
into deep learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 40 UCR datasets and a
real-world user volume dataset demonstrate the excellent performance of our
time series models based on mWDN. In particular, we propose an importance
analysis method to mWDN based models, which successfully identifies those
time-series elements and mWDN layers that are crucially important to time

process, or Brownian motion, as a model of stock price changes), attempts at
understanding the nature of prices and at predicting them have failed.
Statistical methods have only found minor regularities/anomalies, and other
mathematical and physical approaches do not work. This leads researchers to
consider that the evolution of security prices is basically random, and, thus,
inherently not predictable. We show that the evolution of security prices is
not a stochastic process but largely deterministic and governed by a physical
law. The law takes the form of a physicomathematical theory centered around a
purely mathematical function, unrelated to models and statistical methods. It
can be described as an ""isodense"" network of moving regression curves of an
order greater than or equal to 1. The salient aspect of the function is that,
when inputting a time series of any security into the function, new
mathematical objects emerge spontaneously, and these objects exhibit the unique
property of attracting and repelling the quantity. The graphical representation
of the function is called a ""topological network"" due to the preeminence of
shapes over metrics, and the emergent objects are called ""characteristic
figures"" (mainly ""cords""). The attraction and repulsion of the price by the
cords results in the price bouncing from cord to cord. Thus, the price has to
be considered as driven by the cords in a semi-deterministic manner (leaning
towards deterministic). With a function that describes the evolution of the
price, we now understand the reason behind each price movement and can also
predict prices both qualitatively and quantitatively. The function is
universal, does not rely on any fitting, and, due to its extreme sensitivity,
reveals the hidden order in financial time series data that existing research
never uncovered.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=7000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Since Bachelier\'s thesis in 1900 (laying the foundation of the stochastic\nprocess, or Brownian motion, as a model of stock price changes), attempts at\nunderstanding the nature of prices and at predicting them have failed.\nStatistical methods have only found minor regularities/anomalies, and other\nmathematical and physical approaches do not work.

Msun) evolved stars in open clusters. We selected 826 bona fide HARPS
observations of 114 giants from an initial list of 29 open clusters and
computed the half peak-to-peak variability of the HARPS RV measurements, namely
DeltaRV/2, for each target, to search for the best planet-host candidates. We
also performed time series analysis for a few targets with enough observations
to search for orbital solutions. Although we attempted to rule out the presence
of binaries on the basis of previous surveys, we detected 14 new binary
candidates in our sample, most of them identified from a comparison between
HARPS and CORAVEL data. We also suggest 11 new planet-host candidates based on
a relation between the stellar surface gravity and DeltaRV/2. Ten of the
candidates have less than 3 Msun, showing evidence of a low planet occurrence
rate for massive stars. One of the planet-host candidates and one of the binary
candidates show very clear RV periodic variations, allowing us to confirm the
discovery of a new planet and to compute the orbital solution for the binary.
The planet is IC 4651 9122b, with a minimum mass of msini = 6.3 MJ and a
semi-major axis a = 2.0 AU. The binary companion is NGC 5822 201B, with a very
low minimum mass of msini = 0.11 Msun and a semi-major axis a = 6.5 AU, which
is comparable to the Jupiter distance to the Sun.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=7000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Detecting exoplanets in clusters of different ages is a powerful tool for\nunderstanding a number of open questions, such as how the occurrence rate of\nplanets depends on stellar metallicity, on mass, or on stellar environment.

Thus, it
is important to monitor and influence a user's likelihood to return to a site.
Essential to this is predicting when a user will return. Current state of the
art approaches to solve this problem come in two flavors: (1) Recurrent Neural
Network (RNN) based solutions and (2) survival analysis methods. We observe
that both techniques are severely limited when applied to this problem.
Survival models can only incorporate aggregate representations of users instead
of automatically learning a representation directly from a raw time series of
user actions. RNNs can automatically learn features, but can not be directly
trained with examples of non-returning users who have no target value for their
return time. We develop a novel RNN survival model that removes the limitations
of the state of the art methods. We demonstrate that this model can
successfully be applied to return time prediction on a large e-commerce dataset

population without power three months after the storm. Consequently, we
developed a unique data-fusion mapping approach called the Urban Development
Index (UDI) and new open source tool, Comet Time Series (CometTS), to analyze
the recovery of electricity and infrastructure in Puerto Rico. Our approach
incorporates a combination of time series visualizations and change detection
mapping to create depictions of power or infrastructure loss. It also provides
a unique independent assessment of areas that are still struggling to recover.
For this workflow, our time series approach combines nighttime imagery from the
Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer
Suite (NPP VIIRS), multispectral imagery from two Landsat satellites, US Census
data, and crowd-sourced building footprint labels. Based upon our approach we
can identify and evaluate: 1) the recovery of electrical power compared to
pre-storm levels, 2) the location of potentially damaged infrastructure that
has yet to recover from the storm, and 3) the number of persons without power
over time. As of May 31, 2018, declined levels of observed brightness across
the island indicate that 13.9% +/- ~5.6% of persons still lack power and/or
that 13.2% +/- ~5.3% of infrastructure has been lost. In comparison, the Puerto

episodes that strongly affect the star evolution, the dynamics of the disk, and
its chemical evolution. Recently reported extraordinary bursts in the methanol
maser emission may be the observational signature of accretion events in deeply
embedded HMYSOs. Aims: We analyze the light curve of 6.7 GHz methanol masers in
S255IR-NIRS3 during the 2015-2016 burst. Methods: 8.5-year monitoring data with
an average sampling interval of 5 days were obtained with the Torun 32 m radio
telescope. Archival data were added, extending the time series to ~27 years.
Results: The maser emission showed moderate (25-30%) variability on timescales
of months to years over ~23 years since its discovery. The main burst was
preceded by a one-year increase of the total flux density by a factor of 2.5,
then it grew by a factor of 10 over ~0.4 years and declined by a factor of 8
during the consecutive 2.4 years. The peak maser luminosity was a factor of
24.5 higher than the pre-burst quiescent value. The light curves of individual
features showed considerable diversity but indicated a general trend of
suppression of the maser emission at blueshifted (<4.7 km s$^{-1}$) velocities
when the redshifted emission rapidly grew and new emission features appeared at
velocities >5.8 km s$^{-1}$. This new emission provided a contribution of about
80% to the maser luminosity around the peak of the burst. Conclusions: The
onset of the maser burst exactly coincides with that of the infrared burst
estimated from the motion of the light echo. This strongly supports the
radiative pumping scheme of the maser transition. The growth of the maser
luminosity is the result of an increasing volume of gas where the maser

low-dimensional flow features. Using the high-fidelity time series data from
the stabilized finite element Navier-Stokes solver, we first project the

the flow field via a CNN with nonlinear rectification, and the CNN is
iteratively trained using the stochastic gradient descent method to predict the
POD time coefficient when a new flow field is fed to it. The time-averaged flow

research questions concerning financial time series. In the first study we
apply transfer entropy to drawdowns and drawups in foreign exchange rates, to
study their correlation and cross correlation. When applied to daily and hourly
EUR/USD and GBP/USD exchange rates, we find evidence of dependence among the
largest draws (i.e. 5% and 95% quantiles), but not as strong as the correlation
between the daily returns of the same pair of FX rates. In the second study we
use state space models (Hidden Markov Models) of volatility to investigate
volatility spill overs between exchange rates. Among the currency pairs, the
co-movement of EUR/USD and CHF/USD volatility states show the strongest
observed relationship. With the use of transfer entropy, we find evidence for

in practice, we organized a series of circle antipode experiments. In the
experiments, pedestrians are uniformly initialized on the circle and required
to leave for their antipodal positions simultaneously. On the one hand, a
conflicting area is naturally formulated in the central region due to the
converged shortest routes, so the practical conflict avoidance behaviors can be
fully explored. On the other hand, the symmetric experimental conditions of
pedestrians, e.g., symmetric starting points, symmetric destination points, and
symmetric surroundings lay the foundation for further quantitative comparisons
among participants. The pedestrian trajectories in the experiments are
recognized and rotated, and several aspects, e.g., the trajectory space
distribution, route length, travel time, velocity distribution, and
time-series, are investigated. It is found that: (1) Pedestrians prefer the
right-hand side during the experiments; (2) The route length is as the law of
log-normal distribution, the route potential obeys the exponential
distribution, and the travel time is normally distributed as well as the speed;
(3) Taking the short routes unexpectedly cost pedestrians plenty of travel

measure-preserving, ergodic dynamical systems with both atomic and continuous

generator of the system by a compact operator $W_\tau$ on a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS). A key tool is that $W_\tau$ is skew-adjoint , and thus
can be characterized by a unique projection-valued measure, discrete by
compactness, and an associated orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions. These
eigenfunctions can be ordered in terms of a Dirichlet energy on the RKHS, and
provide a notion of coherent observables under the dynamics akin to the Koopman

the regularized generator has a well-defined Borel functional calculus allowing
the construction of a unitary evolution group $\{ e^{t W_\tau}

evolution group of the original system. We establish convergence results for
the spectrum and Borel functional calculus of the regularized generator to

are also established for a data-driven formulation, where these operators are
approximated using finite-rank operators obtained from observed time series. An
advantage of working with an RKHS structure is that one can perform pointwise
evaluation and interpolation through bounded linear operators, which is not
possible in $L^p$ spaces. This enables the out of sample evaluation of

OPTSTREAM is a 4-step procedure consisting of sampling, perturbation,

a small set of points to access in each period of interest. Then, the
perturbation module adds noise to the sampled data points to guarantee privacy.
Next, the reconstruction module reassembles non-sampled data points from the
perturbed sample points. Finally, the post-processing module uses convex
optimization over the private output of the previous modules, as well as the
private answers of additional queries on the data stream, to improve accuracy
by redistributing the added noise. OPTSTREAM is evaluated on a test case

A key component of our\nmethod is a high-speed forecasting algorithm that can be trained online and\nsignificantly outperforms alternatives such as delta coding.\n  Extensive experiments on datasets from many domains show that these results\nhold not only for sensor data but also across a wide array of other time\nseries.""}","[{'name': 'Davis Blalock'}, {'name': 'Samuel Madden'}, {'name': 'John Guttag'}]",{'name': 'John Guttag'},John Guttag,10.1145/3264903,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3264903', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1808.02515v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.02515v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'cs.PF', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.PF', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,

decade, with many new classification approaches published each year. The

Classifier interpretability has become a critical constraint for many
application domains and the introduction of the 'right to explanation' GDPR EU

explainable learning algorithms. In this work we analyse the state-of-the-art
for time series classification, and propose new algorithms that aim to maintain
the classifier accuracy and efficiency, but keep interpretability as a key
design constraint. We present new time series classification algorithms that
advance the state-of-the-art by implementing the following three key ideas: (1)
Multiple resolutions of symbolic approximations: we combine symbolic
representations obtained using different parameters; (2) Multiple domain
representations: we combine symbolic approximations in time (e.g., SAX) and
frequency (e.g., SFA) domains; (3) Efficient navigation of a huge
symbolic-words space: we adapt a symbolic sequence classifier named SEQL, to
make it work with multiple domain representations (e.g., SAX-SEQL, SFA-SEQL),
and use its greedy feature selection strategy to effectively filter the best
features for each representation. We show that a multi-resolution multi-domain
linear classifier, SAX-SFA-SEQL, achieves a similar accuracy to the
state-of-the-art COTE ensemble, and to a recent deep learning method (FCN), but
uses a fraction of the time required by either COTE or FCN. We discuss the

further analyse the interpretability aspect of our classifiers, we present a

We show that a multi-resolution multi-domain\nlinear classifier, SAX-SFA-SEQL, achieves a similar accuracy to the\nstate-of-the-art COTE ensemble, and to a recent deep learning method (FCN), but\nuses a fraction of the time required by either COTE or FCN.

expressions. Each time series is segmented either by fixed-length segmentation

attention module derived from the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell and ideas

LARNN uses attention on its past cell state values for a limited window size
$k$. The formulas are also derived from the Batch Normalized LSTM (BN-LSTM)
cell and the Transformer Network for its Multi-Head Attention Mechanism. The
Multi-Head Attention Mechanism is used inside the cell such that it can query
its own $k$ past values with the attention window. This has the effect of
augmenting the rank of the tensor with the attention mechanism, such that the
cell can perform complex queries to question its previous inner memories, which
should augment the long short-term effect of the memory. With a clever trick,
the LARNN cell with attention can be easily used inside a loop on the cell
state, just like how any other Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) cell can be
looped linearly through time series. This is due to the fact that its state,
which is looped upon throughout time steps within time series, stores the inner
states in a ""first in, first out"" queue which contains the $k$ most recent
states and on which it is easily possible to add static positional encoding
when the queue is represented as a tensor. This neural architecture yields
better results than the vanilla LSTM cells. It can obtain results of 91.92% for

(CNNs) with one-dimensional convolutions to clinical tasks involving
time-series data. This is due, in part, to their computational efficiency,
relative to recurrent neural networks and their ability to efficiently exploit
certain temporal invariances, (e.g., phase invariance). However, it is
well-established that clinical data may exhibit many other types of invariances
(e.g., scaling). While preprocessing techniques, (e.g., dynamic time warping)
may successfully transform and align inputs, their use often requires one to
identify the types of invariances in advance. In contrast, we propose the use
of Sequence Transformer Networks, an end-to-end trainable architecture that
learns to identify and account for invariances in clinical time-series data.
Applied to the task of predicting in-hospital mortality, our proposed approach
achieves an improvement in the area under the receiver operating characteristic

the approximate factor models, we assume that the factors capture all the
non-trivial dynamics of the data, but the cross-sectional dependence may be
explained by both the factors and the idiosyncratic components. Under the
proposed model, (a) the factor process is dynamically dependent and the
idiosyncratic component is a white noise process, and (b) the largest
eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the idiosyncratic components may
diverge to infinity as the dimension $p$ increases. We propose a white noise
testing procedure for high-dimensional time series to determine the number of
white noise components and, hence, the number of common factors, and introduce
a projected Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to eliminate the diverging
effect of the idiosyncratic noises. Asymptotic properties of the proposed
method are established for both fixed $p$ and diverging $p$ as the sample size

To prove
exponential inequalities for non i.i.d random variables allows to extend many
learning techniques to these variables. Indeed, much work has been done both on
inequalities and learning theory for time series, in the past 15 years.
However, for the non independent case, almost all the results concern
stationary time series. This excludes many important applications: for example
any series with a periodic behavior is non-stationary. In this paper, we extend

for Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance between time series. These have many
applications in time series indexing, clustering, forecasting, regression and
classification. One of the key time series classification algorithms, the
nearest neighbor algorithm with DTW distance (NN-DTW) is very expensive to
compute, due to the quadratic complexity of DTW. Lower bound search can speed
up NN-DTW substantially. An effective and tight lower bound quickly prunes off
unpromising nearest neighbor candidates from the search space and minimises the
number of the costly DTW computations. The speed up provided by lower bound
search becomes increasingly critical as training set size increases. Different
lower bounds provide different trade-offs between computation time and
tightness. Most existing lower bounds interact with DTW warping window sizes.
They are very tight and effective at smaller warping window sizes, but become
looser as the warping window increases, thus reducing the pruning effectiveness
for NN-DTW. In this work, we present a new class of lower bounds that are
tighter than the popular Keogh lower bound, while requiring similar computation
time. Our new lower bounds take advantage of the DTW boundary condition,
monotonicity and continuity constraints to create a tighter lower bound. Of
particular significance, they remain relatively tight even for large windows. A
single parameter to these new lower bounds controls the speed-tightness
trade-off. We demonstrate that these new lower bounds provide an exceptional

creating algorithms that have high accuracy on relatively small datasets.
  This paper introduces Proximity Forest, an algorithm that learns accurate
models from datasets with millions of time series, and classifies a time series
in milliseconds. The models are ensembles of highly randomized Proximity Trees.
Whereas conventional decision trees branch on attribute values (and usually
perform poorly on time series), Proximity Trees branch on the proximity of time
series to one exemplar time series or another; allowing us to leverage the
decades of work into developing relevant measures for time series. Proximity
Forest gains both efficiency and accuracy by stochastic selection of both
exemplars and similarity measures.
  Our work is motivated by recent time series applications that provide orders
of magnitude more time series than the UCR benchmarks. Our experiments
demonstrate that Proximity Forest is highly competitive on the UCR archive: it
ranks among the most accurate classifiers while being significantly faster. We
demonstrate on a 1M time series Earth observation dataset that Proximity Forest
retains this accuracy on datasets that are many orders of magnitude greater

support testing resource allocations by using data of the previous releases of
the same project for predicting which software components are likely to be
defective. A validation technique, hereinafter technique defines a specific way
to split available data in training and test sets to measure a classifier
accuracy. Time-series techniques have the unique ability to preserve the
temporal order of data; i.e., preventing the testing set to have data
antecedent to the training set. [Aim] The aim of this paper is twofold: first
we check if there is a difference in the classifiers accuracy measured by
time-series versus non-time-series techniques. Afterward, we check for a
possible reason for this difference, i.e., if defect rates change across
releases of a project. [Method] Our method consists of measuring the accuracy,
i.e., AUC, of 10 classifiers on 13 open and two closed projects by using three
validation techniques, namely cross validation, bootstrap, and walk-forward,
where only the latter is a time-series technique. [Results] We find that the
AUC of the same classifier used on the same project and measured by 10-fold
varies compared to when measured by walk-forward in the range [-0.20, 0.22],

Similarly, the AUC\nmeasured by bootstrap varies compared to when measured by walk-forward in the\nrange [-0.17, 0.43], and it is statistically different in 56% of the cases.\n[Conclusions] We recommend choosing the technique to be used by carefully\nconsidering the conclusions to draw, the property of the available datasets,\nand the level of realism with the classifier usage scenario.'}","[{'name': 'Davide Falessi'}, {'name': 'Jacky Huang'}, {'name': 'Likhita Narayana'}, {'name': 'Jennifer Fong Thai'}, {'name': 'Burak Turhan'}]",{'name': 'Burak Turhan'},Burak Turhan,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01510v2', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.01510v2', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'cs.SE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.SE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,

nonequilibrium dynamics, breaking detailed balance to generate currents. To
power these currents, the entropy of the reservoirs increases. The rate of
entropy production, or dissipation, is a measure of the statistical
irreversibility of the nonequilibrium process. By measuring this
irreversibility in several biological systems, recent experiments have detected
that particular systems are not in equilibrium. Here we discuss three
strategies to replace binary classification (equilibrium versus nonequilibrium)
with a quantification of the entropy production rate. To illustrate, we
generate time-series data for the evolution of an analytically tractable
bead-spring model. Probability currents can be inferred and utilized to
indirectly quantify the entropy production rate, but this approach requires
prohibitive amounts of data in high-dimensional systems. This curse of

numerical simulations for a series of computational problems ranging from image
classification/image recognition, speech recognition, time series analysis,
game intelligence, and computational advertising to numerical approximations of
partial differential equations (PDEs). Such numerical simulations suggest that
ANNs have the capacity to very efficiently approximate high-dimensional
functions and, especially, such numerical simulations indicate that ANNs seem
to admit the fundamental power to overcome the curse of dimensionality when
approximating the high-dimensional functions appearing in the above named
computational problems. There are also a series of rigorous mathematical
approximation results for ANNs in the scientific literature. Some of these
mathematical results prove convergence without convergence rates and some of
these mathematical results even rigorously establish convergence rates but
there are only a few special cases where mathematical results can rigorously
explain the empirical success of ANNs when approximating high-dimensional
functions. The key contribution of this article is to disclose that ANNs can
efficiently approximate high-dimensional functions in the case of numerical

Bayesian learning model, referred to as beta process sticky hidden Markov model

spectrum data, where SHMM models the latent statistical correlation within each
mobile SU's time series data, while BP realizes the cooperation among multiple
SUs. Bayesian inference is then carried out to automatically infer the
heterogeneous spectrum states. Based on the inference results, we also develop
a new algorithm with a refinement mechanism to predict the spectrum
availability, which enables a newly joining SU to immediately access the

distinguish between different types of supernovae, to detect and characterize
extrasolar planets and to classify variable stars. These time series are
usually modeled using a parametric and/or physical model that assumes
independent and homoscedastic errors, but in many cases these assumptions are
not accurate and there remains a temporal dependency structure on the errors.
This can occur, for example, when the proposed model cannot explain all the
variability of the data or when the parameters of the model are not properly
estimated. In this work we define an autoregressive model for irregular
discrete-time series, based on the discrete time representation of the
continuous autoregressive model of order 1. We show that the model is ergodic
and stationary. We further propose a maximum likelihood estimation procedure
and assess the finite sample performance by Monte Carlo simulations. We
implement the model on real and simulated data from Gaussian as well as other
distributions, showing that the model can flexibly adapt to different data

usage. At the same time, to serve increasing user requirements, modern cloud
providers are operating multiple geographically distributed data centers.
Distributed data center infrastructure changes the rules of cloud control, as
energy costs depend on current regional electricity prices and temperatures
that we call geotemporal inputs. Furthermore, pricing policies at which cloud
providers can offer computational resources depend on the quality of service
(QoS). With such pricing schemes and the increasing energy costs in data
centres, balancing energy savings with performance and revenue losses is a
challenging problem. Existing cloud control methods are suitable only for a
single data center or do not consider all the available cloud control actions
that can reduce energy costs in geographically distributed data centers. In
this thesis, we propose a pervasive cloud control approach consisting of
multiple methods for dynamic resource reallocation and hardware configuration
adapted to volatile geotemporal inputs. The proposed methods consider the QoS
impact of cloud control actions and the data quality limits of time series
forecasting methods. We offer a cloud controller design that supports future
extensions when new decision support components need to be added. We also
propose novel pricing schemes which account for the computational resource
availability and costs that arise from our cloud control approach to enable
both flexible, energy-aware and high performance cloud computing. We evaluate
our methods empirically and in a number of simulations using historical traces

At the same time, to serve increasing user requirements, modern cloud\nproviders are operating multiple geographically distributed data centers.\nDistributed data center infrastructure changes the rules of cloud control, as\nenergy costs depend on current regional electricity prices and temperatures\nthat we call geotemporal inputs. Furthermore, pricing policies at which cloud\nproviders can offer computational resources depend on the quality of service\n(QoS). With such pricing schemes and the increasing energy costs in data\ncentres, balancing energy savings with performance and revenue losses is a\nchallenging problem. Existing cloud control methods are suitable only for a\nsingle data center or do not consider all the available cloud control actions\nthat can reduce energy costs in geographically distributed data centers. In\nthis thesis, we propose a pervasive cloud control approach consisting of\nmultiple methods for dynamic resource reallocation and hardware configuration\nadapted to volatile geotemporal inputs. The proposed methods consider the QoS\nimpact of cloud control actions and the data quality limits of time series\nforecasting methods. We offer a cloud controller design that supports future\nextensions when new decision support components need to be added. We also\npropose novel pricing schemes which account for the computational resource\navailability and costs that arise from our cloud control approach to enable\nboth flexible, energy-aware and high performance cloud computing.

CPU-intensive reactive transport models (RTMs): Gaussian processes (GPs),
polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and deep neural networks (DNNs). Besides
direct emulation of the simulated uranium concentration time series, replacing
the original RTM by its emulator is also investigated for global sensitivity
analysis (GSA), uncertainty propagation (UP) and probabilistic calibration
using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. The selected DNN is found to be
superior to both GPs and PCE in reproducing the input - output behavior of the
considered 8-dimensional and 13-dimensional CPU-intensive RTMs. Furthermore,
the two used PCE variants: standard PCE and sparse PCE (sPCE) appear to always
provide the least accuracy while not differing much in performance. As a
consequence of its better emulation capabilities, the used DNN outperforms the
two other methods for UP. In addition, DNNs and GPs offer equally good
approximations to the true first-order and total-order Sobol sensitivity
indices while PCE does somewhat less well. Most surprisingly, despite its
superior emulation skills the DNN approach leads to the worst solution of the
considered synthetic inverse problem which involves 1224 measurement data with
low noise. This apparently contradicting behavior is at least partially due to
the small but complicated deterministic noise that affects the DNN-based
predictions. Indeed, this complex error structure can drive the emulated
solutions far away from the true posterior distribution. Overall, our findings
indicate that when the available training set is relatively small (75 - to 500
input - output examples) and fixed beforehand, DNNs can well emulate RTMs but
are not suited to emulation-based inversion. In contrast, GPs perform fairly
well across all considered tasks: direct emulation, GSA, UP, and inversion.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=7000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'This paper presents a detailed comparison between 3 methods for emulating\nCPU-intensive reactive transport models (RTMs): Gaussian processes (GPs),\npolynomial chaos expansion (PCE) and deep neural networks (DNNs).

18th of April, 2018, will observe nearly the full sky and will provide
time-series imaging data in ~27-day-long campaigns. TESS is equipped with 4
cameras; each has a field-of-view of 24x24 degrees. During the first two years
of the primary mission, one of these cameras, Camera #1, is going to observe
fields centered at an ecliptic latitude of 18 degrees. While the ecliptic plane
itself is not covered during the primary mission, the characteristic scale
height of the main asteroid belt and Kuiper belt implies that a significant

to investigate either the nonlinear or the nonstationary time series for

Brownian motion (fBm) without intermittency correction the measured extremal
point density (EPD) agrees well with a theoretical prediction. For a
multifractal random walk (MRW) with the lognormal statistics, the measured EPD
is independent with the intermittency parameter $\mu$, suggesting that the
intermittency correction does not change the distribution of extremal points,
but change the amplitude. By introducing a coarse-grained operator, the
power-law behavior of these scaling processes is then revealed via the measured
EPD for different scales. For fBm the scaling exponent $\xi(H)$ is found to be
$\xi(H)=H$, where $H$ is Hurst number, while for MRW $\xi(H)$ shows a linear
relation with the intermittency parameter $\mu$. Such EPD approach is further

systems hosted on a mobile ad hoc network (MANET). More specifically, we are
concerned with time-bounded and time-sensitive time-series monitoring data
describing the state of the network and system. The data are harvested in order
to perform an analysis, usually one that requires a global view of the data
taken from distributed sites. For example, network- and application-state data
are typically analysed in order to make operational and maintenance decisions.
MANETs are a challenging environment in which to harvest monitoring data, due
to the inherently unstable and unpredictable connectivity between nodes, and
the overhead of transferring data in a wireless medium. These limitations must
be overcome to support time-series analysis of perishable and time-critical
data. We present an epidemic, delay tolerant, and intelligent method to
efficiently and effectively transfer time-series data between the mobile nodes
of MANETs. The method establishes a network-wide synchronization overlay to
transfer increments of the data over intermediate nodes in periodic cycles. The
data are then accessible from local stores at the nodes. We implemented the
method in Java~EE and present evaluation on a run-time dependence discovery

Trophic web models like Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) can handle fishing fleets as

study was to better understand the Icelandic marine ecosystem and the
interactions within. This was done by constructing an EwE model of Icelandic

the coefficient of determination, the modelling efficiency and the reliability
index to evaluate the model performance. The model performed satisfactorily

Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations detected a strong potassium feature

The 16 Myr old star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 (V1400 Cen) underwent
a series of complex eclipses in May 2007, interpreted as the transit of a giant
Hill sphere filling debris ring system around a secondary companion, J1407b. No
other eclipses have since been detected, although other measurements have
constrained but not uniquely determined the orbital period of J1407b. Finding
another eclipse towards J1407 will help determine the orbital period of the

elementary shapes of infinitesimal neighborhoods of points in the trajectory.
It has been proved that an infinitesimal neighborhood of a point in a

step we estimate the residuals. The mean equation is estimated by OLS and
elastic net and the residuals are estimated by maximum likelihood. Our
contribution is to include a bivariate jump component on a mean reverting jump
diffusion model in the residuals. The models' forecasts are evaluated using
four different criteria, including the energy score to measure whether the
correlation structure between the time series is properly included or not. In
the results it is observed that the models with bivariate jumps provide better

derived from two solar cycles' worth (1996 - 2018) of Global Oscillation
Network Group (GONG) time series for harmonic degrees $l=0 - 150$. We correct
for the effect of fill factor, apparent solar radius, and spurious jumps in the
mode amplitudes. We find that the amplitude of the activity related changes of
$\Gamma$ and $A$ depends on both frequency and harmonic degree of the modes,
with the largest variations of $\Gamma$ for modes with $2400\,\mu\text{Hz}\le
\nu \le 3300\,\mu\text{Hz}$ and $31\le l \le 60$ with a min-to-max variation of

activity, varying by $14.7\pm0.3\%$ and $18.4\pm0.3\%$, respectively, and that
the mode energy supply rates show no significant correlation with activity.

To further our studies, we compare\nthe bidirectional LSTM network with 1D CNN model to prove the capabilities of\nsequence models over feed-forward neural architectures in forecasting related\nproblems.'}","[{'name': 'Maitreya Patel'}, {'name': 'Anery Patel'}, {'name': 'Dr. Ranendu Ghosh'}]",{'name': 'Dr. Ranendu Ghosh'},Dr. Ranendu Ghosh,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.10485v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.10485v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'cs.NE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.NE', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,

Third: Tackles\nefficiently in High Dimensional and Complex set up the estimation of\nconnectivity. Fourth: Incorporates priors at the connectivity level by\npenalizing the groups of variables, corresponding to the Gray Matter anatomical\nsegmentation, and including a probability mask of the anatomically plausible\nconnections.

dynamo and how it causes activity signatures such as dark spots and bright
faculae. We study the appearance of activity signatures in contemporaneous
photometric and chromospheric time series. Lomb-Scargle periodograms are used
to search for cycle periods present in both time series. To emphasize the
signature of the activity cycle we account for rotation-induced scatter in both
data sets by fitting a quasi-periodic Gaussian process model to each observing
season. After subtracting the rotational variability, cycle amplitudes and the
phase difference between the two time series are obtained by fitting both time
series simultaneously using the same cycle period. We find cycle periods in 27
of the 30 stars in our sample. The phase difference between the two time series
reveals that the variability in fast rotating active stars is usually in
anti-phase, while the variability of slowly rotating inactive stars is in
phase. The photometric cycle amplitudes are on average six times larger for the
active stars. The phase and amplitude information demonstrates that active
stars are dominated by dark spots, whereas less active stars are dominated by
bright faculae. We find the transition from spot to faculae domination at the
Vaughan-Preston gap, and around a Rossby number equal to one. We conclude that
faculae are the dominant ingredient of stellar activity cycles at ages >2.55
Gyr. The data further suggest that the Vaughan-Preston gap can not explain the
previously detected dearth of Kepler rotation periods between 15-25 days.

period dearth to be due to the non-detection of periodicity caused by the

dependencies has remained a challenge. In particular, the relationship between
wave height and period statistics is complex, due to the limiting steepness
condition. Here, we present a new simulation method for joint time series of
significant wave height, mean zero-crossing periods and a directional regime
variable. The latter distinguishes between northern and southwestern waves. The
method rests on several model components which include renewal processes,
Fourier series with random coefficients, ARMA processes, copulas and
regime-switching. A particular feature is a data-driven estimate for a wave
height-dependent limiting wave steepness condition which is used to facilitate
copulabased dependence modeling. The method was developed for and applied to a
data set in the Southern North Sea. For this site, the method could simulate
time series with realistic annual cycles and inter-annual variability. In the
time series data, the bivariate distribution of significant wave height and
mean zero-crossing period was well represented. An influence of the directional
regime on the bivariate distribution could also be modeled. However, the
influence was not as strong in simulated data as in observed data. Finally,
simulated series captured duration and inter-arrival time of storm events well.

The\nmethod rests on several model components which include renewal processes,\nFourier series with random coefficients, ARMA processes, copulas and\nregime-switching. A particular feature is a data-driven estimate for a wave\nheight-dependent limiting wave steepness condition which is used to facilitate\ncopulabased dependence modeling. The method was developed for and applied to a\ndata set in the Southern North Sea. For this site, the method could simulate\ntime series with realistic annual cycles and inter-annual variability. In the\ntime series data, the bivariate distribution of significant wave height and\nmean zero-crossing period was well represented. An influence of the directional\nregime on the bivariate distribution could also be modeled. However, the\ninfluence was not as strong in simulated data as in observed data. Finally,\nsimulated series captured duration and inter-arrival time of storm events well.\nPotential applications for output of the simulation method range from the\nassessment of coastal risks or design of coastal structures to the planning and\nbudgeting of offshore operations.'}","[{'name': 'Wiebke S.

The peculiarity of ELM is permitting a certain decrement of the\ncomputing time and complexity regarding the already used BBFNN learning\nalgorithms such as backpropagation, OLS, etc. For the architectural design, a\nrecurrent structure is added to the common BBFNN architecture in order to make\nit more able to deal with complex, non linear and time varying problems.\nThroughout this paper, the conceived recurrent ELM-trained BBFNN is tested on a\nnumber of tasks related to time series prediction, classification and\nregression. Experimental results show noticeable achievements of the proposed\nnetwork compared to common feedforward and recurrent networks trained by ELM\nand using hyperbolic tangent as activation function. These achievements are in\nterms of accuracy and robustness against data breakdowns such as noise signals.'}","[{'name': 'Naima Chouikhi'}, {'name': 'Adel M. Alimi'}]",{'name': 'Adel M.

inference, threat detection, social opinion dynamics, brain activity prediction

challenges are, for example, (i) missing data to construct a closed
time-varying complex network, and (ii) contribution of unknown sources which
are not probed. Towards this end, the current work focuses on statistical
neuron system model with multi-covariates and unknown inputs. Previous research
of neuron activity analysis is mainly limited with effects from the spiking
history of target neuron and the interaction with other neurons in the system
while ignoring the influence of unknown stimuli. We propose to use unknown
unknowns, which describes the effect of unknown stimuli, undetected neuron
activities and all other hidden sources of error. The maximum likelihood
estimation with the fixed-point iteration method is implemented. The
fixed-point iterations converge fast, and the proposed methods can be
efficiently parallelized and offer computational advantage especially when the
input spiking trains are over long time-horizon. The developed framework
provides an intuition into the meaning of having extra degrees-of-freedom in
the data to support the need for unknowns. The proposed algorithm is applied to
simulated spike trains and on real-world experimental data of mouse
somatosensory, mouse retina and cat retina. The model shows a successful
increasing of system likelihood with respect to the conditional intensity
function, and it also reveals the convergence with iterations. Results suggest
that the neural connection model with unknown unknowns can efficiently estimate
the statistical properties of the process by increasing the network likelihood.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=7000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Identification of patterns from discrete data time-series for statistical\ninference, threat detection, social opinion dynamics, brain activity prediction\nhas received recent momentum.

Previous research\nof neuron activity analysis is mainly limited with effects from the spiking\nhistory of target neuron and the interaction with other neurons in the system\nwhile ignoring the influence of unknown stimuli. We propose to use unknown\nunknowns, which describes the effect of unknown stimuli, undetected neuron\nactivities and all other hidden sources of error. The maximum likelihood\nestimation with the fixed-point iteration method is implemented. The\nfixed-point iterations converge fast, and the proposed methods can be\nefficiently parallelized and offer computational advantage especially when the\ninput spiking trains are over long time-horizon. The developed framework\nprovides an intuition into the meaning of having extra degrees-of-freedom in\nthe data to support the need for unknowns. The proposed algorithm is applied to\nsimulated spike trains and on real-world experimental data of mouse\nsomatosensory, mouse retina and cat retina. The model shows a successful\nincreasing of system likelihood with respect to the conditional intensity\nfunction, and it also reveals the convergence with iterations. Results suggest\nthat the neural connection model with unknown unknowns can efficiently estimate\nthe statistical properties of the process by increasing the network likelihood.'}","[{'name': 'Ruochen Yang'}, {'name': 'Gaurav Gupta'}, {'name': 'Paul Bogdan'}]",{'name': 'Paul Bogdan'},Paul Bogdan,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00688v2', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00688v2', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'q-bio.NC', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,

capabilities in many computer vision tasks such as image recognition and object
localization. Apart from these applications, deep Convolutional Neural Networks

This is surprising as the accuracy of deep learning models for TSC could
potentially be improved if the model is fine-tuned from a pre-trained neural
network instead of training it from scratch. In this paper, we fill this gap by
investigating how to transfer deep CNNs for the TSC task. To evaluate the
potential of transfer learning, we performed extensive experiments using the

degrade the model's predictions depending on the dataset used for transfer.
Therefore, in an effort to predict the best source dataset for a given target

good precision. We have identified and photometrically characterised a sample
of 230 detached close-orbiting eclipsing binaries with low-mass main-sequence
components in the Catalina Sky Survey. These low-mass stars have masses of $M
\leq 1.0\ M_{\odot}$ and orbital periods shorter than $2$ days. The adopted
method provided a robust estimate of stellar parameters (as mass and fractional
radius) by using only light curves and photometric colours, since no
spectroscopic information was available for these objects. A SDSS-2MASS
ten-colour grid of composite synthetic and observed colours and the K-Nearest
Neighbours method were employed to identify main-sequence stars and to estimate
their effective temperatures, typically of $T_{\rm eff}\leq 5720$ K. Each light
curve was modelled with the JKTEBOP code together with an asexual genetic
algorithm to obtain the most coherent values for the fitted parameters. The
present work provides an unprecedented number of homogeneous estimates of main
stellar parameters in short-period low-mass binary systems. The distribution of
the components of the investigated detached eclipsing binaries in the
mass-radius diagram supports a trend of radius inflation on low-mass
main-sequence stars. A relative increase of inflation for lower masses is also
found and our results suggest that the secondaries are more inflated, i.e. they
present larger radii than the primary components of same mass, when compared to

The adopted\nmethod provided a robust estimate of stellar parameters (as mass and fractional\nradius) by using only light curves and photometric colours, since no\nspectroscopic information was available for these objects. A SDSS-2MASS\nten-colour grid of composite synthetic and observed colours and the K-Nearest\nNeighbours method were employed to identify main-sequence stars and to estimate\ntheir effective temperatures, typically of $T_{\\rm eff}\\leq 5720$ K. Each light\ncurve was modelled with the JKTEBOP code together with an asexual genetic\nalgorithm to obtain the most coherent values for the fitted parameters. The\npresent work provides an unprecedented number of homogeneous estimates of main\nstellar parameters in short-period low-mass binary systems. The distribution of\nthe components of the investigated detached eclipsing binaries in the\nmass-radius diagram supports a trend of radius inflation on low-mass\nmain-sequence stars. A relative increase of inflation for lower masses is also\nfound and our results suggest that the secondaries are more inflated, i.e. they\npresent larger radii than the primary components of same mass, when compared to\nstellar evolutionary models.'}","[{'name': 'Hernan E.

photometric time-series data. Specifically, we aim to identify asymmetric
transits with ingress that is more rapid than egress, as expected for cometary

manually vetted. We applied this algorithm to all long cadence light curves
from the Kepler mission, finding 16 candidate transits with significant
asymmetry, 11 of which were found to be artefacts or symmetric transits after
manual inspection. Of the 5 remaining events, four are the 0.1% depth events
previously identified for KIC 3542116 and 11084727. We identify HD 182952 (KIC
8027456) as a third system showing a potential comet transit. All three stars

In this paper, we present an effective time-series segmentation technique that
extracts optimal time segments of individual's similar behavioral
characteristics utilizing their mobile phone data. One of the determinants of
an individual's behavior is the various activities undertaken at various
times-of-the-day and days-of-the-week. In many cases, such behavior will follow
temporal patterns. Currently, researchers use either equal or unequal
interval-based segmentation of time for mining mobile phone users' behavior.
Most of them take into account static temporal coverage of 24-h-a-day and few
of them take into account the number of incidences in time-series data.
However, such segmentations do not necessarily map to the patterns of
individual user activity and subsequent behavior because of not taking into
account the diverse behaviors of individuals over time-of-the-week. Therefore,
we propose a behavior-oriented time segmentation (BOTS) technique that takes
into account not only the temporal coverage of the week but also the number of
incidences of diverse behaviors dynamically for producing similar behavioral
time segments over the week utilizing time-series data. Experiments on the real

methodology, has traditionally been carried out under the assumption of

Nevertheless, as is often the case with independent functional data, it may
well happen that the data available to the analyst are not the actual sequence
of curves, but relatively few and noisy measurements per curve, potentially at
different locations in each curve's domain. Under this sparse sampling regime,
neither the established estimators of the time series' dynamics, nor their
corresponding theoretical analysis will apply. The subject of this paper is to
tackle the problem of estimating the dynamics and of recovering the latent
process of smooth curves in the sparse regime. Assuming smoothness of the
latent curves, we construct a consistent nonparametric estimator of the series'
spectral density operator and use it develop a frequency-domain recovery
approach, that predicts the latent curve at a given time by borrowing strength
from the (estimated) dynamic correlations in the series across time. Further to
predicting the latent curves from their noisy point samples, the method fills
in gaps in the sequence (curves nowhere sampled), denoises the data, and serves
as a basis for forecasting. Means of providing corresponding confidence bands
are also investigated. A simulation study interestingly suggests that sparse
observation for a longer time period, may be provide better performance than
dense observation for a shorter period, in the presence of smoothness. The

classification of emotions based on electroencephalogram (EEG) time series.

estimator of the fluctuation function which obeys the following principles: The
first relates the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation function to the

Such correlation is\nlarger for the lower anemometers, indicating that ambient temperature is an\nimportant forcing of the wind speed variability in the vicinity of the ground.'}","[{'name': 'Fabian Guignard'}, {'name': 'Dasaraden Mauree'}, {'name': 'Michele Lovallo'}, {'name': 'Mikhail Kanevski'}, {'name': 'Luciano Telesca'}]",{'name': 'Luciano Telesca'},Luciano Telesca,10.3390/e21010047,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/e21010047', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.00822v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.00822v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","10 pages, 7 figures","{'term': 'stat.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'stat.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]","Entropy 2019, 21(1), 47",

between the various proposed dynamo mechanisms believed to be the main cause of
starspot activity. For this research it is important to collect observation
time series that are long enough to unravel both long- and short-term spot
evolution. Doppler imaging is a very efficient method for studying spots of
stars that cannot be angularly resolved. Aims. High-resolution spectral
observations during 1994-2017 are analysed in order to reveal long- and
short-term changes in the spot activity of the FK Comae-type subgiant HD
199178. Methods. Most of the observations were collected with the Nordic
Optical Telescope. The Doppler imaging temperature maps were calculated using
an inversion technique based on Tikhonov regularisation and utilising multiple
spectral lines. Results. We present a unique series of 41 temperature maps
spanning more than 23 years. All reliable images show a large cool spot region
centred near the visible rotation pole. Some lower latitude cool features are
also recovered, although the reliability of these is questionable. There is an
expected anti-correlation between the mean surface temperature and the spot
coverage. Using the Doppler images, we construct the equivalent of a solar
butterfly diagram for HD 199178. Conclusions. HD 199178 clearly has a long-term
large and cool spot structure at the rotational pole. This spot structure
dominated the spot activity during the years 1994-2017. The size and position

and is used to identify sleep disorders. In sleep medicine, clinicians
interpret raw EEG signals in so-called sleep stages, which are assigned by
experts to every 30s window of signal. For diagnosis, they also rely on shorter
prototypical micro-architecture events which exhibit variable durations and
shapes, such as spindles, K-complexes or arousals. Annotating such events is
traditionally performed by a trained sleep expert, making the process time
consuming, tedious and subject to inter-scorer variability. To automate this
procedure, various methods have been developed, yet these are event-specific
and rely on the extraction of hand-crafted features.
  New method: We propose a novel deep learning architecure called Dreem One
Shot Event Detector (DOSED). DOSED jointly predicts locations, durations and
types of events in EEG time series. The proposed approach, applied here on
sleep related micro-architecture events, is inspired by object detectors
developed for computer vision such as YOLO and SSD. It relies on a
convolutional neural network that builds a feature representation from raw EEG
signals, as well as two modules performing localization and classification
respectively.
  Results and comparison with other methods: The proposed approach is tested on
4 datasets and 3 types of events (spindles, K-complexes, arousals) and compared
to the current state-of-the-art detection algorithms.
  Conclusions: Results demonstrate the versatility of this new approach and
improved performance compared to the current state-of-the-art detection
methods.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=7000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Background: Electroencephalography (EEG) monitors brain activity during sleep\nand is used to identify sleep disorders.

Time series mining handles several tasks such as classification, clustering,
query-by-content, prediction, and others. Performing data mining tasks on raw
time series is inefficient as these data are high-dimensional by nature.
Instead, time series are first pre-processed using several techniques before
different data mining tasks can be performed on them. In general, there are two
main approaches to reduce time series dimensionality, the first is what we call
landmark methods. These methods are based on finding characteristic features in
the target time series. The second is based on data transformations. These
methods transform the time series from the original space into a reduced space,
where they can be managed more efficiently. The method we present in this paper
applies a third approach, as it projects a time series onto a lower-dimensional
space by selecting important points in the time series. The novelty of our
method is that these points are not chosen according to a geometric criterion,
which is subjective in most cases, but through an optimization process. The
other important characteristic of our method is that these important points are
selected on a dataset-level and not on a single time series-level. The direct
advantage of this strategy is that the distance defined on the low-dimensional
space lower bounds the original distance applied to raw data. This enables us
to apply the popular GEMINI algorithm. The promising results of our experiments

(DNNs) has achieved an excellent success in image classification, speech
recognition. But DNNs are suffer great deal of challenges for time series
forecasting because most of the time series data are nonlinear in nature and
highly dynamic in behaviour. The time series forecasting has a great impact on
our socio-economic environment. Hence, to deal with these challenges its need
to be redefined the DNN model and keeping this in mind, data pre-processing,
network architecture and network parameters are need to be consider before
feeding the data into DNN models. Data normalization is the basic data
pre-processing technique form which learning is to be done. The effectiveness
of time series forecasting is heavily depend on the data normalization
technique. In this paper, different normalization methods are used on time

lines in the Sun's corona, and for instigating rapid jet-like bursts in the

Solar Rossby waves (r modes) have recently been discovered in the
near-surface horizontal flow field using the techniques of granulation-tracking
and ring-diagram analysis applied to six years of SDO/HMI data.
  Aims. Here we apply time-distance helioseismology to the combined SOHO/MDI
and SDO/HMI data sets, which cover 21 years of observations from May 1996 to
April 2017. The goal of this study is to provide an independent confirmation
over two solar cycles and in deeper layers of the Sun.
  Methods. We have measured south-north helioseismic travel times along the
equator, which are sensitive to subsurface north-south flows. To reduce noise,
the travel times were averaged over travel distances from 6$^\circ$ to
30$^\circ$; the mean distance corresponds to a p-mode lower turning point of
0.91 $R_\odot$. The 21-year time series of travel-time measurements was split
into three seven-year subsets and transformed to obtain power spectra in a
corotating frame.

classical sectoral Rossby waves for azimuthal wavenumbers in the range $3 \leq
m \leq 15$. The mode frequencies and linewidths of the modes with $m \leq 9$

e-folding lifetimes on the order of a few months, the longest lived mode,
$m=3$, has an e-folding lifetime of more than one year. For each mode, the rms
velocity at the equator is in the range of 1--3 m s$^{-1}$ , with the largest

This comparative analysis demonstrates that an LSTM\nwith attention can indeed outperform standalone LSTMs but further investigation\nis required as issues do arise with such model architectures.""}","[{'name': 'Thomas Hollis'}, {'name': 'Antoine Viscardi'}, {'name': 'Seung Eun Yi'}]",{'name': 'Seung Eun Yi'},Seung Eun Yi,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07699v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.07699v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,

to billing and network provisioning, has become a cornerstone of today's
computer networks. Previous studies have developed traffic classification
techniques using classical machine learning algorithms and deep learning
methods when large quantities of labeled data are available. However, capturing
large labeled datasets is a cumbersome and time-consuming process. In this
paper, we propose a semi-supervised approach that obviates the need for large
labeled datasets. We first pre-train a model on a large unlabeled dataset where
the input is the time series features of a few sampled packets. Then the
learned weights are transferred to a new model that is re-trained on a small
labeled dataset. We show that our semi-supervised approach achieves almost the
same accuracy as a fully-supervised method with a large labeled dataset, though
we use only 20 samples per class. In tests based on a dataset generated from
the more challenging QUIC protocol, our approach yields 98% accuracy. To show

two transits of HAT-P-11b with the Optical System for Imaging and

the systematic effects and red noise present in the time series in an effort to
measure the change of the planet-to-star radius ratio
($R_\mathrm{p}/R_\mathrm{s}$) across wavelength. By fitting both transits
together, we find a slope in the transmission spectrum showing an increase of
the planetary radius towards blue wavelengths. A closer inspection to the
transmission spectrum of the individual data sets reveals that the first
transit presents this slope while the transmission spectrum of the second data
set is flat. Additionally we detect hints of Na absorption in the first night,

absorption excess found in the first transit observation are caused by
unocculted stellar spots. Modeling the contribution of unocculted spots to
reproduce the results of the first night we find a spot filling factor of

spectrographs have produced vast quantities of high-resolution,
high-signal-to-noise time-series spectra for bright stars. These data contain
valuable information for the dual purposes of planet detection via the measured
RVs and stellar characterization via the co-added spectra. However,
considerable data analysis challenges exist in extracting these data products
from the observed spectra at the highest possible precision, including the
issue of poorly-characterized telluric absorption features and the common use
of an assumed stellar spectral template. In both of these examples,
precision-limiting reliance on external information can be sidestepped using
the data directly. Here we propose a data-driven method to simultaneously
extract precise RVs and infer the underlying stellar and telluric spectra using
a linear model (in the log of flux). The model employs a convex objective and
convex regularization to keep the optimization of the spectral components fast.
We implement this method in wobble, an open-source python package which uses
TensorFlow in one of its first non-neural-network applications to astronomical
data. In this work, we demonstrate the performance of wobble on archival HARPS
spectra. We recover the canonical exoplanet 51 Pegasi b, detect the secular RV
evolution of the M dwarf Barnard's Star, and retrieve the Rossiter-McLaughlin

In both of these examples,\nprecision-limiting reliance on external information can be sidestepped using\nthe data directly. Here we propose a data-driven method to simultaneously\nextract precise RVs and infer the underlying stellar and telluric spectra using\na linear model (in the log of flux). The model employs a convex objective and\nconvex regularization to keep the optimization of the spectral components fast.\nWe implement this method in wobble, an open-source python package which uses\nTensorFlow in one of its first non-neural-network applications to astronomical\ndata. In this work, we demonstrate the performance of wobble on archival HARPS\nspectra. We recover the canonical exoplanet 51 Pegasi b, detect the secular RV\nevolution of the M dwarf Barnard's Star, and retrieve the Rossiter-McLaughlin\neffect for the Hot Jupiter HD 189733b. The method additionally produces\nextremely high-S/N composite stellar spectra and detailed time-variable\ntelluric spectra, which we also present here.""}","[{'name': 'Megan Bedell'}, {'name': 'David W.

photometry, the Transit Least Squares (TLS) algorithm. TLS searches for
transit-like features while taking the stellar limb darkening and planetary
ingress and egress into account. We have optimized TLS for both signal
detection efficiency (SDE) of small planets and computational speed. TLS
analyses the entire, unbinned phase-folded light curve. We compensate for the
higher computational load by (i.) using algorithms like ""Mergesort"" (for the
trial orbital phases) and by (ii.) restricting the trial transit durations to a
smaller range that encompasses all known planets, and using stellar density
priors where available. A typical K2 light curve, including 80d of observations
at a cadence of 30min, can be searched with TLS in ~10s real time on a standard
laptop computer, as fast as the widely used Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm.
We perform a transit injection-retrieval experiment of Earth-sized planets
around sun-like stars using synthetic light curves with 110ppm white noise per
30min cadence, corresponding to a photometrically quiet KP=12 star observed
with Kepler. We determine the SDE thresholds for both BLS and TLS to reach a
false positive rate of 1% to be SDE~7 in both cases. The resulting true
positive (or recovery) rates are ~93% for TLS and ~76% for BLS, implying more
reliable detections with TLS. We also test TLS with the K2 light curve of the
TRAPPIST-1 system and find six of seven Earth-sized planets using an iterative
search for increasingly lower signal detection efficiency, the phase-folded
transit of the seventh planet being affected by a stellar flare. TLS is more
reliable than BLS in finding any kind of transiting planet but it is
particularly suited for the detection of small planets in long time series from
Kepler, TESS, and PLATO. We make our Python implementation of TLS publicly

multiwavelength, multiphase, time-series direct-imaging observations and
accompanying analyses that may improve the robustness of exoplanet ocean
detection by spatially mapping the ocean glint signal. As the planet rotates,
the glint spot appears to ""blink"" as Lambertian scattering continents interrupt

source of periodic variability in crescent-phase reflected light curves. We
invert these light curves to constrain the longitudinal slice maps and apparent
albedo of two surfaces at both quadrature and crescent phase. At crescent
phase, the retrieved apparent albedo of ocean-bearing longitudinal slices is
increased by a factor of 5, compared to the albedo at quadrature phase, due to
the contribution from glint. The land-bearing slices exhibit no significant
change in apparent albedo with phase. The presence of forward-scattering clouds
in our simulated observation increases the overall reflectivity toward
crescent, but clouds do not correlate with any specific surfaces, thereby
allowing for the phase-dependent glint effect to be interpreted as distinct

responses to vasoactive titrations by training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
using EMR data.
  Materials and Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed EMR of patients
admitted to a pediatric ICU from 2009 to 2017. Data included charted time
series vitals, labs, drugs, and interventions of children with septic shock
treated with dopamine, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. A RNN was trained to
predict responses in heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic
blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) to 8,640 titrations
during 652 septic episodes and evaluated on a holdout set of 3,883 titrations
during 254 episodes. A linear regression model using titration data as its sole
input was also developed and compared to the RNN model. Evaluation methods
included the correlation coefficient between actual physiologic responses and
RNN predictions, mean absolute error (MAE), and area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC).
  Results: The actual physiologic responses displayed significant variability
and were more accurately predicted by the RNN model than by titration alone
(r=0.20 vs r=0.05, p<0.01). The RNN showed MAE and AUC improvements over the
linear model. The RNN's MAEs associated with dopamine and epinephrine were 1-3%
lower than the linear regression model MAE for HR, SBP, DBP, and MAP. Across
all vitals vasoactives, the RNN achieved 1-19% AUC improvement over the linear
model.
  Conclusion: This initial attempt in pediatric critical care to predict
individual physiologic responses to vasoactive dose changes in children with
septic shock demonstrated an RNN model showed some improvement over a linear
model. While not yet clinically applicable, further development may assist
clinical administration of vasoactive medications in children with septic
shock.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=7000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""Objective: Predict individual septic children's personalized physiologic\nresponses to vasoactive titrations by training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\nusing EMR data.\n  Materials and Methods: This study retrospectively analyzed EMR of patients\nadmitted to a pediatric ICU from 2009 to 2017.

the widening of the current statistics of low-mass planets, through the
in-depth analysis of precise radial velocity measurements in a narrow range of
spectral sub-types. As part of that program, we obtained radial velocity
measurements of Gl 686, an M1 dwarf at d = 8.2 pc. The analysis of data
obtained within an intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess
dispersion is due to a coherent signal, with a period of 15.53 d. Almost
simultaneous photometric observations were carried out within the APACHE and

periodic variations related to activity from signals due to the presence of
planetary companions, complemented also with ASAS photometric data. We took
advantage of the available radial velocity measurements for this target from
other observing campaigns. The analysis of the radial velocity composite time
series from the HIRES, HARPS and HARPS-N spectrographs, consisting of 198
measurements taken over 20 years, enabled us to address the nature of periodic
signals and also to characterize stellar physical parameters (mass,
temperature, and rotation). We report the discovery of a super-Earth orbiting

shown great promise in helping make sense of EEG signals due to its capacity to
learn good feature representations from raw data. Whether DL truly presents
advantages as compared to more traditional EEG processing approaches, however,
remains an open question. In this work, we review 156 papers that apply DL to
EEG, published between January 2010 and July 2018, and spanning different
application domains such as epilepsy, sleep, brain-computer interfacing, and
cognitive and affective monitoring. We extract trends and highlight interesting
approaches in order to inform future research and formulate recommendations.

the preprocessing methodology, 3) the DL design choices, 4) the results, and 5)
the reproducibility of the experiments. Our analysis reveals that the amount of

By combining high signal-to-noise (S/N)\nradial-velocity data from the ground-based SONG network with continuous\nspace-based data from the revised Kepler mission K2, we derive and characterize\n27 individual oscillation modes for epsilon Tau, along with global oscillation\nparameters such as the large frequency separation and the ratio between the\namplitude of the oscillations measured in radial velocity and intensity as a\nfunction of frequency. The latter has been measured previously for only two\nstars, the Sun and Procyon. Combining the seismic analysis with interferometric\nand spectroscopic measurements, we derive physical parameters for epsilon Tau,\nand discuss its evolutionary status.'}","[{'name': 'Torben Arentoft'}, {'name': 'Frank Grundahl'}, {'name': 'Timothy R.

to spatial image in the field of seismic exploration, i.e., reconstructing the
velocity model directly from seismic data by deep neural networks (DNNs). The
conventional way of addressing this ill-posed inversion problem is through
iterative algorithms, which suffer from poor nonlinear mapping and strong
nonuniqueness. Other attempts may either import human intervention errors or
underuse seismic data. The challenge for DNNs mainly lies in the weak spatial
correspondence, the uncertain reflection-reception relationship between seismic
data and velocity model, as well as the time-varying property of seismic data.
To tackle these challenges, we propose end-to-end seismic inversion networks
(SeisInvNets) with novel components to make the best use of all seismic data.
Specifically, we start with every seismic trace and enhance it with its
neighborhood information, its observation setup, and the global context of its
corresponding seismic profile. From the enhanced seismic traces, the spatially
aligned feature maps can be learned and further concatenated to reconstruct a
velocity model. In general, we let every seismic trace contribute to the
reconstruction of the whole velocity model by finding spatial correspondence.
The proposed SeisInvNet consistently produces improvements over the baselines
and achieves promising performance on our synthesized and proposed SeisInv data
set according to various evaluation metrics. The inversion results are more
consistent with the target from the aspects of velocity values, subsurface
structures, and geological interfaces. Moreover, the mechanism and the
generalization of the proposed method are discussed and verified. Nevertheless,
the generalization of deep-learning-based inversion methods on real data is
still challenging and considering physics may be one potential solution.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=7000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We propose a new method to tackle the mapping challenge from time-series data\nto spatial image in the field of seismic exploration, i.e., reconstructing the\nvelocity model directly from seismic data by deep neural networks (DNNs).

This observation demonstrates that flares with hot FUV\ncontinuum temperatures and significant EUV/FUV energy deposition will continue\nto be of importance to exoplanet atmospheric chemistry and heating even as the\nhost M dwarfs age beyond their most active evolutionary phases.'}","[{'name': 'C.

late-type main-sequence stars and confirm the transiting planets. The most
advanced spectrometers are approaching a precision of $\sim 10$ cm/s that
implies the need to identify and correct for all possible sources of RV
oscillations intrinsic to the star down to this level and possibly beyond. The
recent discovery of global-scale equatorial Rossby waves in the Sun, also
called r modes, prompted us to investigate their possible signature in stellar
RV measurements. R modes are toroidal modes of oscillation whose restoring
force is the Coriolis force and propagate in the retrograde direction in a
frame that corotates with the star. The solar r modes with azimuthal orders $3
\leq m \lesssim 15$ were identified unambiguously because of their dispersion
relation and their long e-folding lifetimes of hundreds of days. Here we
simulate the RV oscillations produced by sectoral r modes with $2 \leq m \leq
5$ assuming a stellar rotation period of 25.54 days and a maximum amplitude of
the surface velocity of each mode of 2 m/s. This amplitude is representative of
the solar measurements, except for the $m=2$ mode which has not yet been
observed. Sectoral r modes with azimuthal orders $m=2$ and $3$ would produce RV
oscillations with amplitudes of 76.4 and 19.6 cm/s and periods of 19.16 and
10.22 days, respectively, for a star with an inclination of the rotation axis
$i=60^{\circ}$. Therefore, they may produce rather sharp peaks in the Fourier
spectrum of the radial velocity time series that could lead to spurious
planetary detections. Sectoral r~modes may represent a source of confusion in
the case of slowly rotating inactive stars that are preferential targets for RV
planet search. The main limitation of the present investigation is the lack of
observational constraint on the amplitude of the $m=2$ mode on the Sun.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=7000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Radial velocity (RV) measurements are used to search for planets orbiting\nlate-type main-sequence stars and confirm the transiting planets.

gravitational wave telescope, for optimal detections of supernova events. As a
part of our project, we released a web application named SuperNova Event
Gravitational-wave-display in Fukuoka (SNEGRAF) in autumn 2018. SNEGRAF accepts
the users' theoretical waveforms as a plain text file consisting of a time
series of $h_{+}$ and $h_{\times}$ (the plus and cross mode of gravitational
waves, respectively), then displays the input, a corresponding spectrogram, and
power spectrum together with KAGRA sensitivity curve and the signal-to-noise
ratio; we adopt Google Visualization API for the interactive visualization of
the input waveforms. However, it is a time-consuming task to draw more than
$\sim 10^{5}$ data points directly with JavaScript, although the number can be
typical for a supernova hunt by assuming a typical duration of the event and
sampling rate of the detectors; a combination of recursive decimations of the
original in the server-side program and an appropriate selection of them
depending on the time duration requested by the user in a web browser achieves
an acceptable latency. In this paper, we present the current design,

To this end, we\nhave been developing an original data processing pipeline for KAGRA, a Japanese\ngravitational wave telescope, for optimal detections of supernova events. As a\npart of our project, we released a web application named SuperNova Event\nGravitational-wave-display in Fukuoka (SNEGRAF) in autumn 2018. SNEGRAF accepts\nthe users' theoretical waveforms as a plain text file consisting of a time\nseries of $h_{+}$ and $h_{\\times}$ (the plus and cross mode of gravitational\nwaves, respectively), then displays the input, a corresponding spectrogram, and\npower spectrum together with KAGRA sensitivity curve and the signal-to-noise\nratio; we adopt Google Visualization API for the interactive visualization of\nthe input waveforms. However, it is a time-consuming task to draw more than\n$\\sim 10^{5}$ data points directly with JavaScript, although the number can be\ntypical for a supernova hunt by assuming a typical duration of the event and\nsampling rate of the detectors; a combination of recursive decimations of the\noriginal in the server-side program and an appropriate selection of them\ndepending on the time duration requested by the user in a web browser achieves\nan acceptable latency.

mortality, morbidity, and health costs. Its management is highly time-sensitive
since each hour of delayed treatment increases mortality due to irreversible
organ damage. Meanwhile, despite decades of clinical research, robust
biomarkers for sepsis are missing. Therefore, detecting sepsis early by
utilizing the affluence of high-resolution intensive care records has become a
challenging machine learning problem. Recent advances in deep learning and data
mining promise to deliver a powerful set of tools to efficiently address this
task. This empirical study proposes two novel approaches for the early
detection of sepsis: a deep learning model and a lazy learner based on time
series distances. Our deep learning model employs a temporal convolutional
network that is embedded in a Multi-task Gaussian Process Adapter framework,
making it directly applicable to irregularly-spaced time series data. Our lazy
learner, by contrast, is an ensemble approach that employs dynamic time
warping. We frame the timely detection of sepsis as a supervised time series
classification task. For this, we derive the most recent sepsis definition in
an hourly resolution to provide the first fully accessible early sepsis
detection environment. Seven hours before sepsis onset, our methods improve

Therefore, detecting sepsis early by\nutilizing the affluence of high-resolution intensive care records has become a\nchallenging machine learning problem. Recent advances in deep learning and data\nmining promise to deliver a powerful set of tools to efficiently address this\ntask. This empirical study proposes two novel approaches for the early\ndetection of sepsis: a deep learning model and a lazy learner based on time\nseries distances. Our deep learning model employs a temporal convolutional\nnetwork that is embedded in a Multi-task Gaussian Process Adapter framework,\nmaking it directly applicable to irregularly-spaced time series data. Our lazy\nlearner, by contrast, is an ensemble approach that employs dynamic time\nwarping. We frame the timely detection of sepsis as a supervised time series\nclassification task. For this, we derive the most recent sepsis definition in\nan hourly resolution to provide the first fully accessible early sepsis\ndetection environment. Seven hours before sepsis onset, our methods improve\narea under the precision--recall curve from 0.25 to 0.35/0.40 over the state of\nthe art.

High-precision pulsar-timing experiments are affected by temporal
variations of the Dispersion Measure (DM), which are related to spatial
variations in the interstellar electron content. Correcting for DM variations
relies on the cold-plasma dispersion law which states that the dispersive delay
varies with the squared inverse of the observing frequency. This may however
give incorrect measurements if the probed electron content (and therefore the
DM) varies with observing frequency, as is predicted theoretically.
  Aims. We study small-scale density variations in the ionised interstellar
medium. These structures may lead to frequency-dependent DMs in pulsar signals
and could inhibit the use of lower-frequency pulsar observations to correct
time-variable interstellar dispersion in higher-frequency pulsar-timing data.
  Methods. We used high-cadence, low-frequency observations with three stations
from the German LOng-Wavelength (GLOW) consortium, which are part of the LOw
Frequency ARray (LOFAR). Specifically, 3.5 years of weekly observations of PSR
J2219+4754 are presented.
  Results. We present the first detection of frequency-dependent DMs towards
any interstellar object and a precise multi-year time-series of the time- and
frequency-dependence of the measured DMs. The observed DM variability is
significant and may be caused by extreme scattering events. Potential causes
for frequency-dependent DMs are quantified and evaluated.
  Conclusions. We conclude that frequency-dependence of DMs has been reliably
detected and is caused by small-scale (up to 10s of AUs) but steep density
variations in the interstellar electron content. We find that long-term trends
in DM variability equally affect DMs measured at both ends of our frequency
band and hence the negative impact on long-term high-precision timing projects
is expected to be limited.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=7000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Context.

Thirty subjects, from a retrospective study, of which 11 were classified as dry

were performed using E300 videokeratoscope (Medmont Pty., Ltd, Melbourne,
Australia). Raw data was analyzed using a recently proposed method to estimate

five parameters were extracted and analyzed, including non-invasive break up

activations by acquiring diffusion-weighed spin-echo images. In previous
studies, dfMRI showed higher spatial accuracy at activation mapping compared to
classic functional MRI approaches. However, it remains unclear whether dfMRI
measures result from changes in the intra-/extracellular environment, perfusion
and/or T2 values. We designed an acquisition/quantification scheme to
disentangle such effects in the motor cortex during a finger tapping paradigm.
dfMRI was acquired at specific diffusion weightings to selectively suppress
perfusion and free-water diffusion, then times series of the apparent diffusion
coefficient (ADC-fMRI) and of the perfusion signal fraction (IVIM-fMRI) were
derived. ADC-fMRI provided ADC estimates sensitive to changes in perfusion and
free-water volume, but not to T2/T2* values. With IVIM-fMRI we isolated the

features/patterns from data without dwelling on domain expertise although seems
highly promising but comes at the cost of high reliance on large amount of

knowledge into the network has three key advantages: (a) Reduction in the

reported, based on measurements with the SOPHIE spectrograph. Current data do
not allow us to distinguish between a 12.95-day period and its one-day alias at
1.08 days, but favour the former slightly. The velocity variation has an
amplitude of 1.6 m/s, making this the lowest-amplitude signal detected with
SOPHIE up to now. We have performed a detailed analysis of the significance of
the signal and its origin, including extensive simulations with both
uncorrelated and correlated noise, representing the signal induced by stellar
activity. The signal is significantly detected, and the results from all tests
point to its planetary origin. Additionally, the presence of an additional
acceleration in the velocity time series is suggested by the current data. On
the other hand, a previously reported signal with a period of 9.9 days,
detected in HIRES velocities of this star, is not recovered in the SOPHIE data.
An independent analysis of the HIRES dataset also fails to unveil the 9.9-day
signal.

with SOPHIE implies the presence of a planet, called Gl411 b, with a minimum
mass of around three Earth masses, orbiting its star at a distance of 0.079 AU.
The planet receives about 3.5 times the insolation received by Earth, which
implies an equilibrium temperature between 255 K and 350 K, and makes it too
hot to be in the habitable zone. At a distance of only 2.5 pc, Gl411 b, is the

Using Pareto smoothed importance sampling, we\npropose a method for approximating exact LFO-CV that drastically reduces the\ncomputational costs while also providing informative diagnostics about the\nquality of the approximation.""}","[{'name': 'Paul-Christian Bürkner'}, {'name': 'Jonah Gabry'}, {'name': 'Aki Vehtari'}]",{'name': 'Aki Vehtari'},Aki Vehtari,10.1080/00949655.2020.1783262,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00949655.2020.1783262', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06281v5', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.06281v5', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","28 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables","{'term': 'stat.ME', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'stat.ME', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation (2020),

Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), in a solar
coronal arcade using a newly developed analysis procedure that employs
spatio-temporal auto-correlations. We test our new procedure by studying
large-amplitude oscillations excited by nearby flaring activity within a
complex arcade and detect a dominant periodicity of 12.5 minutes. We compute
this period in two ways: from the traditional time-distance fitting method and
using our new auto-correlation procedure. The two analyses yield consistent
results. The auto-correlation procedure is then implemented on time series for
which the traditional method would fail due to the complexity of overlapping

disclosing it prompts serious threats to individuals' privacy. To limit such
concerns, organizations often provide analysts with aggregate time-series that
indicate, e.g., how many people are in a location at a time interval, rather
than raw individual traces. In this paper, we perform a measurement study to
understand Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on aggregate location
time-series, where an adversary tries to infer whether a specific user
contributed to the aggregates.
  We find that the volume of contributed data, as well as the regularity and
particularity of users' mobility patterns, play a crucial role in the attack's
success. We experiment with a wide range of defenses based on generalization,
hiding, and perturbation, and evaluate their ability to thwart the attack
vis-a-vis the utility loss they introduce for various mobility analytics tasks.
  Our results show that some defenses fail across the board, while others work
for specific tasks on aggregate location time-series. For instance, suppressing
small counts can be used for ranking hotspots, data generalization for
forecasting traffic, hotspot discovery, and map inference, while sampling is
effective for location labeling and anomaly detection when the dataset is
sparse. Differentially private techniques provide reasonable accuracy only in
very specific settings, e.g., discovering hotspots and forecasting their
traffic, and more so when using weaker privacy notions like crowd-blending
privacy. Overall, our measurements show that there does not exist a unique

To limit such\nconcerns, organizations often provide analysts with aggregate time-series that\nindicate, e.g., how many people are in a location at a time interval, rather\nthan raw individual traces. In this paper, we perform a measurement study to\nunderstand Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on aggregate location\ntime-series, where an adversary tries to infer whether a specific user\ncontributed to the aggregates.\n  We find that the volume of contributed data, as well as the regularity and\nparticularity of users' mobility patterns, play a crucial role in the attack's\nsuccess. We experiment with a wide range of defenses based on generalization,\nhiding, and perturbation, and evaluate their ability to thwart the attack\nvis-a-vis the utility loss they introduce for various mobility analytics tasks.\n  Our results show that some defenses fail across the board, while others work\nfor specific tasks on aggregate location time-series. For instance, suppressing\nsmall counts can be used for ranking hotspots, data generalization for\nforecasting traffic, hotspot discovery, and map inference, while sampling is\neffective for location labeling and anomaly detection when the dataset is\nsparse. Differentially private techniques provide reasonable accuracy only in\nvery specific settings, e.g., discovering hotspots and forecasting their\ntraffic, and more so when using weaker privacy notions like crowd-blending\nprivacy. Overall, our measurements show that there does not exist a unique\ngeneric defense that can preserve the utility of the analytics for arbitrary\napplications, and provide useful insights regarding the disclosure of sanitized\naggregate location time-series.""}","[{'name': 'Apostolos Pyrgelis'}, {'name': 'Carmela Troncoso'}, {'name': 'Emiliano De Cristofaro'}]",{'name': 'Emiliano De Cristofaro'},Emiliano De Cristofaro,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.07456v2', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.07456v2', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"{'term': 'cs.CR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.CR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]","Presented at ACM SIGMETRICS 2020 and published in the Proceedings

accurate stellar parameters. The photometry from space telescopes has provided
superb data that allowed asteroseismic characterisation of thousands of stars.

goal is to use the granulation and/or oscillation time scales measured from
photometric time series of bright red giants (1.6$\leq$Vmag$\leq$5.3) observed
with BRITE to determine stellar surface gravities and masses. Methods: We use
probabilistic methods to characterize the granulation and/or oscillation signal
in the power density spectra and the autocorrelation function of the BRITE time

red giant stars and extract the corresponding time scales from the power

seismic scaling relations, we use parameters from a large sample of Kepler

risk. Approach: We developed a prediction framework that forecasts onsets of
acute intracranial hypertension in the next 8 hours. It jointly uses cerebral
auto-regulation indices, spectral energies and morphological pulse metrics to
describe the neurological state of the patient. One-minute base windows were
compressed by computing signal metrics, and then stored in a multi-scale

high-frequency waveforms substantially improved the prediction performance over

model approach where the random component, conditioned on the past information,
follows a beta distribution, while the conditional mean specification may
include covariates and also an extra additive term given by the iteration of a
map that can present chaotic behavior. The resulting model is very flexible and
its systematic component can accommodate short and long range dependence,
periodic behavior, laminar phases, etc. We derive easily verifiable conditions
for the stationarity of the proposed model, as well as conditions for the law
of large numbers and a Birkhoff-type theorem to hold. A Monte Carlo simulation

We present the first high-cadence multi-wavelength radial-velocity

and reference values for the global helioseismic parameters {\nu_{max}}, and
{\Delta \nu} of the solar p-modes using the SONG instrument. The obtained data
set or the inferred values should then be used when the scaling relations are
applied to other stars showing solar-like oscillations which are observed with

the power spectrum of the time series to determine {\nu_{max}}; simple Gaussian
fitting and heavy smoothing of the power spectrum. {\Delta\nu} was determined
using the method of autocorrelation of the power spectrum. The amplitude per
radial mode was determined using the method described in Kjeldsen et al.

In this\npaper, we model fMRI data as functional time series and develop tools for the\ndetection of deviations from covariance stationarity via change point\nalternatives. We propose a nonparametric procedure which is based on dimension\nreduction techniques. However, as the projection of the functional time series\non a finite and rather low-dimensional subspace involves the risk of missing\nchanges which are orthogonal to the projection space, we also consider two test\nstatistics which take the full functional structure into account. The proposed\nmethods are compared in a simulation study and applied to more than 100 resting\nstate fMRI data sets.'}","[{'name': 'Christina Stoehr'}, {'name': 'John A D Aston'}, {'name': 'Claudia Kirch'}]",{'name': 'Claudia Kirch'},Claudia Kirch,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00288v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.00288v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","39 pages, 11 figures","{'term': 'stat.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'stat.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': '62P10', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,

scenario). For the set of values of the map's parameter $\mu$ for which the
orbits are periodic with period $2^n$, Feigenbaum graphs are fully
characterised by two integers (n,k) and admit an algebraic structure. We
explore the spectral properties of these graphs for finite n and k, and among

distinguish chaos from an iid process, it is not a good measure to quantify the
chaoticity of the process, and that the eigenvalue density does a better job.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=7000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""A Horizontal Visibility Graph (HVG) is a simple graph extracted from an\nordered sequence of real values, and this mapping has been used to provide a\ncombinatorial encryption of time series for the task of performing network\nbased time series analysis.
