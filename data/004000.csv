""what-connects-to-what-when"" is to create a time-series (or rather a sequence)
of graphs through temporal discretization (bandwidth selection) and spatial
discretization (vertex contraction). Such discretization together with
non-negative factorization techniques can be useful for obtaining clustering of
graphs. Motivating application of performing clustering of graphs (as opposed
to vertex clustering) can be found in neuroscience and in social network
analysis, and it can also be used to enhance community detection (i.e., vertex
clustering) by way of conditioning on the cluster labels. In this paper, we
formulate a problem of clustering of graphs as a model selection problem. Our

pulsator. The system harbours four planetary-mass companions detected by direct
imaging, and is a good solar system analogue. The masses of the companions are
not known accurately, because the estimation depends strongly on the age of the
system, which is also not known with sufficient accuracy. Asteroseismic studies
of the star might help to better constrain the age of HR 8799. We organized an
extensive photometric and multi-site spectroscopic observing campaign for
studying the pulsations of the central star.
  Aims: The aim of the present study is to investigate the pulsation properties
of HR 8799 in detail via the ultra-precise 47-d-long nearly continuous
photometry obtained with the MOST space telescope, and to find as many
independent pulsation modes as possible, which is the prerequisite of an
asteroseismic age determination.
  Methods: We carried out Fourier analysis of the wide-band photometric time
series.
  Results: We find that resonance and sudden amplitude changes characterize the
pulsation of HR 8799. The dominant frequency is always at f1 = 1.978 c/d. Many
multiples of one ninth of the dominant frequency appear in the Fourier spectrum
of the MOST data: n/9 f1, where n={1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 17,

decrease and phase variations even on the 47-d time-scale. The dependencies
between the pulsation frequencies of HR 8799 make the planned subsequent

It is found that in the difference between the sums of the areas of\nthe sunspot groups in 0-10 deg latitude intervals of northern and southern\nhemispheres, there exist ~9-year periodicity during the high activity period\n1940-1980 and ~12-year periodicity during the low activity period 1890-1939. It\nis also found that there exists a high correlation (85% from 128 data points)\nbetween the sum of the areas of the sunspot groups in 0-10 deg latitude\ninterval of the southern hemisphere during a Qth year (middle year of 3-year\nsmoothed time series) and the annual mean International Sunspot Number (Rz) of\n(Q+9)th year.

Methods. We applied the Morlet wavelet (6th order), which offers high time and
frequency resolution. By applying the wavelet transform to the signal, we
obtain the wavelet local and global power spectra. The first is interpreted as
energy distribution of the signal in time-frequency space, and the second is

Since internal mixing processes influence their lives, it is very important to
place constraints on the corresponding physical parameters, such as core
overshooting and the internal rotation profile, so as to calibrate their
stellar structure and evolution models. Although asteroseismology has been
shown to be able to deliver the most precise constraints so far, the number of
detailed seismic studies delivering quantitative results is limited. Our goal
is to extend this limited sample with an in-depth case study and provide a
well-constrained set of asteroseismic parameters, contributing to the ongoing
mapping efforts of the instability strips of the beta Cep and SPB stars. We
derived fundamental parameters from high-resolution spectra using spectral
synthesis techniques. We used custom masks to obtain optimal light curves from
the original pixel level data from the Kepler satellite. We used standard
time-series analysis tools to construct a set of significant pulsation modes
that provide the basis for the seismic analysis carried out afterwards. We find
that KIC 10526294 is a cool SPB star, one of the slowest rotators ever found.
Despite this, the length of Kepler observations is sufficient to resolve narrow
rotationally split multiplets for each of its 19 quasi-equally spaced dipole
modes. The number of detected consecutive (in radial order) dipole modes in
this series is higher than ever before. The observed amount of splitting shows
an increasing trend towards longer periods, which - largely independent of the
seismically calibrated stellar models - points towards a non-rigid internal
rotation profile. From the average splitting we deduce a rotation period of
~188 d. From seismic modelling, we find that the star is young with a central
hydrogen mass fraction X_c>0.64; it has a core overshooting alpha_ov<=0.15.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Massive stars are important for the chemical enrichment of the universe.\nSince internal mixing processes influence their lives, it is very important to\nplace constraints on the corresponding physical parameters, such as core\novershooting and the internal rotation profile, so as to calibrate their\nstellar structure and evolution models.

filter out linear dependences). Important nonlinear properties of autonomic
nocturnal regulation in short-term variability in healthy young persons are
associated with $RR$-increments: accelerations and decelerations of a size
greater than about 35 ms. They reveal that large accelerations are more likely
antipersistent, while large decelerations are more likely persistent. Changes
in $RR$-increments in a heart deprived of autonomic supervision are much lower

observed time series of these option prices. The statistical analysis of such a
multi-dimensional time series of option prices corresponding to $n$ strikes
(with $n$ large, e.g. $n\geq 40$) and the same maturity, is a difficult task
due to the fact that option prices at any moment in time satisfy non-linear and
non-explicit no-arbitrage restrictions. Hence any $n$-dimensional time series
model also has to satisfy these implicit restrictions at each time step, a
condition that is impossible to meet since the model innovations can take

terms of the parameters of the corresponding risk-neutral measure and then
performing the time series analysis in the parameter space. The option price

determine mesoscale features such as ""community structure"", in which densely
connected sets of nodes constitute ""communities"" that have sparse connections
to other communities. The most popular way of detecting communities
algorithmically is to optimize the quality function known as modularity. When
optimizing modularity, one compares the actual connections in a (static or
time-dependent) network to the connections obtained from a random-graph
ensemble that acts as a null model. The communities are then the sets of nodes
that are connected to each other densely relative to what is expected from the
null model. Clearly, the process of community detection depends fundamentally
on the choice of null model, so it is important to develop and analyze novel
null models that take into account appropriate features of the system under
study. In this paper, we investigate the effects of using null models that take
incorporate spatial information, and we propose a novel null model based on the
radiation model of population spread. We also develop novel synthetic spatial
benchmark networks in which the connections between entities are based on
distance or flux between nodes, and we compare the performance of both static

model for modularity optimization and a recently-proposed gravity null model.

Psc revealed an excess of oscillation power around 32 $\mu$Hz and a large
frequency separation of 4.1$\pm$0.1$\mu$Hz. $\theta^1$ Tau exhibits oscillation
power around 90 $\mu$Hz, with a large frequency separation of
6.9$\pm$0.2$\mu$Hz. Scaling relations indicate that $\gamma$ Psc is a star of
about $\sim$1 M$_\odot$ and $\sim$10 R$_\odot$. $\theta^1$ Tau appears to be a

of the exoplanetary radial-velocity fits. We show that the traditional model of
the Doppler noise with an additive jitter can generate large non-linearity
effects, decreasing the reliability of the fit, especially in the cases when a
correleated Doppler noise is involved. We introduce a regularization of the
additive noise model that can gracefully eliminate its singularities together
with the associated non-linearity effects.
  We apply this approach to Doppler time-series data of several exoplanetary
systems. It demonstrates that our new regularized noise model yields orbital
fits that have either increased or at least the same statistical robustness, in
comparison with the simple additive jitter. Various statistical uncertainties
in the parametric estimations are often reduced, while planet detection
significance is often increased.
  Concerning the 55 Cnc five-planet system, we show that its Doppler data
contain significant correlated (""red"") noise. Its correlation timescale is in
the range from days to months, and its magnitude is much larger than the effect
of the planetary N-body perturbations in the radial velocity (these
perturbations thus appear undetectable). Characteristics of the red noise
depend on the spectrograph/observatory, and also show a cyclic time variation
in phase with the public Ca II H & K and photometry measurements. We interpret
this modulation as a hint of the long-term activity cycle of 55 Cnc, similar to

differential photometry of our targets (with typical errors of $\pm$15-30~mmag

measurement. This reference flux is computed using three nearby, probably

stocks behave, and Transfer Entropy, which is non-symmetric and measures the
influence of the time series of one stock onto another in terms of the
information that the time series of one stock transmits to the time series of

of the events is above a certain threshold, or from time series, when the
intensity of a signal surpasses a threshold value. We are particularly
concerned by the time between these extreme events, called respectively waiting
time and quiet time. If the thresholds are high enough it is possible to
justify the existence of scaling laws for the probability distribution of the
times as a function of the threshold value, although the scaling functions are
different in each case. For point processes, in addition to the trivial Poisson
process, one can obtain double-power-law distributions with no finite mean
value. This is justified in the context of renormalization-group
transformations, where such distributions arise as limiting distributions after
iterations of the transformation. Clear connections with the generalized
central limit theorem are established from here. The non-existence of finite
moments leads to a semi-parametric scaling law in terms of the sample mean
waiting time, in which the (usually unkown) scale parameter is eliminated but
not the exponents. In the case of time series, scaling can arise by considering
random-walk-like signals with absorbing boundaries, resulting in distributions
with a power-law ""bulk"" and a faster decay for long times. For large thresholds
the moments of the quiet-time distribution show a power-law dependence with the
scale parameter, and isolation of the latter and of the exponents leads to a
non-parametric scaling law in terms only of the moments of the distribution.
Conclusions about the projections of changes in the occurrence of natural
hazards lead to the necessity of distinguishing the behavior of the mean of the

complex-valued random variables indexed by the integers, to fields of random
variables that are labelled by elements of the unitary dual of a compact group.
The covariance is positive definite, and so it is the Fourier transform of a
finite central measure (the spectral measure of the field) on the group.
Analogues of the Cramer and Kolmogorov theorems are extended to this framework.

novel version of the previously introduced TOP method alleviates some
inconsistencies by imposing that the lead-lag relationship should be invariant
with respect to a time reversal of the time series after a change of sign. This
means that, if `$X$ comes before $Y$', this transforms into `$Y$ comes before
$X$' under a time reversal. We show that previously proposed bootstrap test
lacks power and leads too often to a lack of rejection of the null that there
is no lead-lag correlation when it is present. We introduce instead two novel
tests. The first the free energy p-value $\rho$ criterion quantifies the
probability that a given lead-lag structure could be obtained from random time
series with similar characteristics except for the lead-lag information. The
second self-consistent test embodies the idea that, for the lead-lag path to be
significant, synchronizing the two time series using the time varying lead-lag
path should lead to a statistically significant correlation. We perform
intensive synthetic tests to demonstrate their performance and limitations.
Finally, we apply the TOPS method with the two new tests to the time dependent
lead-lag structures of house price and monetary policy of the United Kingdom
(UK) and United States (US) from 1991 to 2011. The TOPS approach stresses the
importance of accounting for change of regimes, so that similar pieces of

steep power spectral densities. This demonstration highlights the dangers of
interpreting them as signs of a physical connection. We show that by using
interpolation and the Hanning sampling window function we are able to reduce
the effects of red-noise leakage and to recover steep simple power-law power
spectral densities. We also introduce the use of a Neyman construction for the

a challenge in modern astrophysics for more than 30 yr and their amplitude in

to a resonance effect, the gravity modes of low degree and low order have the
largest impact on the $^{8}B$ neutrino flux. The strongest effect is expected
to occur for the dipole mode with radial order $2$, corresponding to periods of
about 1.5 hr. These standing gravity waves produce temperature fluctuations
that are amplified by a factor of 170 in the boron neutrino flux for the
corresponding period, in consonance with the gravity modes. From current
neutrino observations, we determine that the maximum temperature variation due

This study clearly shows that due to their high sensitivity to the temperature,
the $^8B$ neutrino flux time series is an excellent tool to determine the
properties of gravity modes in the solar core. Moreover, if gravity mode
footprints are discovered in the $^{8}B$ neutrino flux, this opens a new line

energy distribution shape. We use three mechanisms to identify variables in the

significant periodicity. We also identified variables on the longest timescales
possible of ~6 years, by comparing measurements taken early in the Spitzer
mission with the mean from our YSOVAR campaign. The fraction of members in each
cluster that are variable on these longest timescales is a function of the
ratio of Class I/total members in each cluster, such that clusters with a
higher fraction of Class I objects also have a higher fraction of long-term

filtration rate (eGFR). However, eGFR values are recorded without reference to
the creatinine (SCr) assays used to derive them, and newer assays were

method by comparing the mapping of SCr values on to eGFR values across a
time-series of paired eGFR and SCr measurements.
  Setting: Routinely collected primary care data from 20,000 people with the
richest renal function data from the Quality Improvement in Chronic Kidney
Disease (QICKD) trial.
  Results: The algorithm identified a change in eGFR calculation method in 80
(63%) of the 127 included practices. This change was identified in 4,736
(23.7%) patient time series analysed. This change in calibration method was
found to cause a significant step change in reported eGFR values producing a
systematic bias. eGFR values could not be recalibrated by applying the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation to the laboratory
reported SCr values.
  Conclusions: This algorithm can identify laboratory changes in eGFR
calculation methods and changes in SCr assay. Failure to account for these
changes may misconstrue renal function changes over time. Researchers using
routine eGFR data should account for these effects.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Introduction: Kidney function is reported using estimates of glomerular\nfiltration rate (eGFR).

the delayed detonation model and the production of $\sim$0.6 $\rm M_\odot$ of

Possible explanations for\nthis extraordinary variability include the impact onto the dusty disc of either\na single small rocky planetesimal, or of material from a highly eccentric\ndebris tail. The increase in flux from the emission lines is sufficient that\nsimilar events could be detected in the broadband photometry of ongoing and\nfuture large-area time domain surveys.'}","[{'name': 'David J Wilson'}, {'name': 'Boris Gaensicke'}, {'name': 'Detlev Koester'}, {'name': 'Roberto Raddi'}, {'name': 'Elmé Breedt'}, {'name': 'John Southworth'}, {'name': 'Steven G.

reliably recover the transit parameters for a wide range of systematics
functions. None of the tested model selection criteria - including the BIC -

that are based on simple model selection may underestimate the uncertainties
when extracting transmission and eclipse spectra from real data, and
low-significance claims using such techniques should be treated with caution.

evolution of the correlation between SC and a suitably windowed FC. Assessing
the statistical significance of the time series against random phase
permutations, our data show a pronounced peak of significance for time window
widths around 20-30 TR (40-60 sec). Using the appropriate window width, we show
that FC patterns oscillate between phases of high modularity, primarily shaped
by anatomy, and phases of low modularity, primarily shaped by inter-network
connectivity. Building upon recent results in dynamic FC, this emphasizes the
potential role of SC as a transitory architecture between different highly

power spectra by gap-filling preserving the original information, that is, in
the case of asteroseismology, the stellar oscillation frequency content. We
make use of a forward-backward predictor based on autoregressive moving average
modelling (ARMA) in the time domain. The method MIARMA is particularly suitable
for replacing invalid data such as those present in the light curves of the
CoRoT satellite due to the pass through the South Atlantic Anomaly, and
eventually for the data gathered by the NASA planet hunter Kepler. We select a
sample of stars from the ultra-precise photometry collected by the
asteroseismic camera on board the CoRoT satellite: the {\delta} Scuti star HD
174966, showing periodic variations of the same order as the CoRoT
observational window, the Be star HD 51193, showing longer time variations, and
the solar-like HD 49933, with rapid time variations. We showed that in some
cases linear interpolations are less reliable to what was believed. In
particular: the power spectrum of HD 174966 is clearly aliased when this
interpolation is used for filling the gaps; the light curve of HD 51193
presents a much more aliased spectrum than expected for a low frequency
harmonic signal; and finally, although the linear interpolation does not affect
noticeably the power spectrum of the CoRoT light curve of the solar-like star
HD 49933, the ARMA interpolation showed rapid variations previously
unidentified that ARMA interprets as a signal. In any case, the ARMA
interpolation method provides a cleaner power spectrum, that is, less

suitable method for filling gaps in the light curves of pulsating stars

in data that arises due to lack of observations for a variety of reasons. Such

computed values of correlation dimension of the system, without using any

derived from standard chaotic systems, like the R{\""o}ssler and Lorenz, with
frequency of occurrence and size of missing data drawn from two Gaussian
distributions. Then we study the changes in correlation dimension with change
in the distributions of position and size of gaps. We find that for a
considerable range of mean gap frequency and size, the value of correlation
dimension is not significantly affected, indicating that in such specific
cases, the calculated values can still be reliable and acceptable. Thus our
study introduces a method of checking the reliability of computed correlation
dimension values by calculating the distribution of gaps with respect to its
size and position. This is illustrated for the data from light curves of three
variable stars, R Scuti, U Monocerotis and SU Tauri. We also demonstrate how a
cubic spline interpolation can cause a time series of Gaussian noise with
missing data to be misinterpreted as being chaotic in origin. This is
demonstrated for the non chaotic light curve of variable star SS Cygni, which
gives a saturated D$_{2}$ value, when interpolated using a cubic spline. In

photometry and low-resolution spectroscopy for the WZ Sge-type dwarf nova EZ
Lyn during its 2010 superoutburst. Dual-band photometry revealed that the
$g'-i'$ color reddened with a decrease in brightness, during the main
superoutburst and the following rebrightening phase, whereas the color became
bluer with a further decrease in brightness during the slow, final decline
phase. With a fit to our photometric results by a blackbody function, we
estimated the disk radius ratio (ratio of the disk radius to the binary
separation) and compared this with that of V455 And, a WZ Sge-type object that
did not show any rebrightening in the 2007 superoutburst. The comparison
revealed: (1) the disk radius ratio of EZ Lyn decreased more slowly than that
of V455 And; and (2) the radius ratio of EZ Lyn at the end of the main
superoutburst was larger than that of the V455 And. These results favor the
mass reservoir model for the mechanism of rebrightening. During both the
superoutburst plateau and subsequent rebrightening phase, H$\alpha$ and
H$\beta$ lines were detected. The H$\alpha$ line showed a double-peak profile
from which we estimated the disk radius ratio. The comparison of this ratio
with that derived by photometry, indicates that the H$\alpha$ disk was larger
than the photometric one, which suggests that the optically thin gas was
extended to the outer region more than the optically thick gas disk and was
possibly responsible for the rebrightening phenomenon. Time-series dual-band
photometry during the main superoutburst revealed that color variations during
the early superhump show roughly the same behavior as that of V455 And, whereas

expanding the frontiers of knowledge on exoplanets toward higher stellar
masses, and to constrain star-planet interaction mechanisms. These stars,

We have, over the last 10 years, monitored about 1000 evolved stars for radial
velocity variations in search for low-mass companions under the Penn State -
Toru\'n Centre for Astronomy Planet Search with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope.
Selected prospective candidates that required higher RV precision meassurements

sound statistics on the frequency and intrinsic nature of these systems, and to
deliver in-depth studies of selected planetary systems with evidences of
star-planet interaction processes.
  Methods. We have obtained for TYC 1422-614-1 69 epochs of precise radial
velocity measurements collected over 3651 days with the Hobby-Eberly Telescope,

the season of interest using modified versions of data from previous seasons,
allowing for reasonable variations in the timing, pace, and intensity of the
seasonal epidemics, as well as noise in observations. Since the framework does
not make strict domain-specific assumptions, it can easily be applied to other
diseases as well. Another important advantage of this method is that it
produces a complete posterior distribution for any desired forecasting target,
rather than mere point predictions. We report prospective

Our approach instead produces possibilities for the epidemic curve of\nthe season of interest using modified versions of data from previous seasons,\nallowing for reasonable variations in the timing, pace, and intensity of the\nseasonal epidemics, as well as noise in observations. Since the framework does\nnot make strict domain-specific assumptions, it can easily be applied to other\ndiseases as well. Another important advantage of this method is that it\nproduces a complete posterior distribution for any desired forecasting target,\nrather than mere point predictions. We report prospective\ninfluenza-like-illness forecasts that were made for the 2013--2014 U.S.\ninfluenza season, and compare the framework\'s cross-validated prediction error\non historical data to that of a variety of simpler baseline predictors.'}","[{'name': 'Logan C.

Surface differential rotation and other global surface flows on
magnetically active stars are among the observable manifestations of the
stellar dynamo working underneath. Therefore, such observations are important
for stellar dynamo theory and useful constraints for solar dynamo studies as
well.
  Aims. The active K1-giant component of the long-period RS CVn-type binary
system sigma Gem and its global surface flow pattern is revisited.
  Methods. We refine the differential rotation law from recovering the spot
migration pattern. We apply a detailed cross-correlation technique to a unique
set of 34 time-series Doppler images recovered using data from 1996/97. By
increasing the number of the available cross-correlation function maps from the
formerly used 4 to 17 we expect a more robust determination of the differential
surface rotation law. In addition, we present a new time-series Doppler imaging
study of sigma Gem using our advanced surface reconstruction code iMap for a
dataset collected in 2006/07.
  Results. Results from the reprocessed cross-correlation study confirm that
the star performs antisolar-type differential rotation with a surface shear
alpha of -0.04 +/- 0.01, i.e., almost a factor of two stronger compared to the
previously claimed value. We also confirm the evidence of a global poleward

The active K1-giant component of the long-period RS CVn-type binary\nsystem sigma Gem and its global surface flow pattern is revisited.\n  Methods. We refine the differential rotation law from recovering the spot\nmigration pattern. We apply a detailed cross-correlation technique to a unique\nset of 34 time-series Doppler images recovered using data from 1996/97. By\nincreasing the number of the available cross-correlation function maps from the\nformerly used 4 to 17 we expect a more robust determination of the differential\nsurface rotation law. In addition, we present a new time-series Doppler imaging\nstudy of sigma Gem using our advanced surface reconstruction code iMap for a\ndataset collected in 2006/07.\n  Results. Results from the reprocessed cross-correlation study confirm that\nthe star performs antisolar-type differential rotation with a surface shear\nalpha of -0.04 +/- 0.01, i.e., almost a factor of two stronger compared to the\npreviously claimed value.

For detection of individual\nchirps of duration $\\tau=1$ s, the method is one order of magnitude more\nsensitive in SNR than Fourier analysis. The Fourier-chirp spectra of GRB 010408\nand GRB 970816 show a continuation of the spectral slope up to 1 kHz of\nturbulence identified in low frequency Fourier analysis. The same continuation\nis observed in an ensemble averaged spectrum of 40 bright long GRBs. An outlook\non a similar analysis of upcoming gravitational wave data is included.'}","[{'name': 'Maurice H. P.

a third `target' variable, one must decompose the total information into

addressing this. Some possible definitions for PID quantities have been
proposed, and some analyses have been carried out on systems composed of
discrete variables. Here we present the first in-depth analysis of PIDs on

reduces to the minimum information provided by either source variable, and
hence is independent of correlation between sources; (ii) synergy is the extra
information contributed by the weaker source when the stronger source is known,
and can either increase or decrease with correlation between sources. We find
that Gaussian systems frequently exhibit net synergy, i.e. the information
carried jointly by both sources is greater than the sum of informations carried
by each source individually. Drawing from several explicit examples, we discuss
the implications of these findings for measures of information transfer and
information-based measures of complexity, both generally and within a

introducing a soft kernel spectral clustering (SKSC) algorithm, which can

strategy based upon KSC for community detection of static networks is proposed,
where the extraction of a high quality training sub-graph, the choice of the

algorithm for the analysis of evolving networks called kernel spectral
clustering with memory effect (MKSC), where the temporal smoothness between
clustering results in successive time steps is incorporated at the level of the
primal optimization problem, by properly modifying the KSC formulation. Later
on, an application of KSC to fault detection of an industrial machine is
presented. Here, a smart pre-processing of the data by means of a proper
windowing operation is necessary to catch the ongoing degradation process

possible to raise an early warning when necessary, in an online fashion.
Finally, we propose a new algorithm called incremental kernel spectral
clustering (IKSC) for online learning of non-stationary data. This ambitious
challenge is faced by taking advantage of the out-of-sample property of kernel

motions around lower-mass stars, which helps make M dwarfs excellent targets
for extra-solar planet searches. State of the art velocimeters with $\sim$1m/s
stability can detect very low-mass planets out to the habitable zone of these
stars. Low-mass, small, planets are abundant around M dwarfs, and most known
potentially habitable planets orbit one of these cool stars.
  Aims. Our M-dwarf radial velocity monitoring with HARPS on the ESO 3.6m
telescope at La Silla observatory makes a major contribution to this sample.
  Methods. We present here dense radial velocity (RV) time series for three M
dwarfs observed over $\sim5$ years: GJ 3293 (0.42M$_\odot$), GJ 3341
(0.47M$_\odot$), and GJ 3543 (0.45M$_\odot$). We extract those RVs through
minimum $\chi^2$ matching of each spectrum against a high S/N ratio stack of
all observed spectra for the same star. We then vet potential orbital signals
against several stellar activity indicators, to disentangle the Keplerian
variations induced by planets from the spurious signals which result from
rotational modulation of stellar surface inhomogeneities and from activity
cycles.
  Results. Two Neptune-mass planets - $msin(i)=1.4\pm0.1$ and
$1.3\pm0.1M_{nept}$ - orbit GJ 3293 with periods $P=30.60\pm0.02$ d and
$P=123.98\pm0.38$ d, possibly together with a super-Earth -
$msin(i)\sim7.9\pm1.4M_\oplus$ - with period $P=48.14\pm0.12\;d$. A super-Earth

characterized by an exponential growth in time, we show that district-level
Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in West Africa follow slower
polynomial-based growth kinetics over several generations of the disease.
Methods: We analyzed epidemic growth patterns at three different spatial scales
(regional, national, and subnational) of the Ebola virus disease epidemic in
Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia by compiling publicly available weekly time
series of reported EVD case numbers from the patient database available from
the World Health Organization website for the period 05-Jan to 17-Dec 2014.
Results: We found significant differences in the growth patterns of EVD cases
at the scale of the country, district, and other subnational administrative
divisions. The national cumulative curves of EVD cases in Guinea, Sierra Leone,
and Liberia show periods of approximate exponential growth. In contrast, local
epidemics are asynchronous and exhibit slow growth patterns during 3 or more
EVD generations, which can be better approximated by a polynomial than an
exponential. Conclusions: The slower than expected growth pattern of local EVD
outbreaks could result from a variety of factors, including behavior changes,
success of control interventions, or intrinsic features of the disease such as
a high level of clustering. Quantifying the contribution of each of these
factors could help refine estimates of final epidemic size and the relative
impact of different mitigation efforts in current and future EVD outbreaks.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Background: While many infectious disease epidemics are initially\ncharacterized by an exponential growth in time, we show that district-level\nEbola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in West Africa follow slower\npolynomial-based growth kinetics over several generations of the disease.\nMethods: We analyzed epidemic growth patterns at three different spatial scales\n(regional, national, and subnational) of the Ebola virus disease epidemic in\nGuinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia by compiling publicly available weekly time\nseries of reported EVD case numbers from the patient database available from\nthe World Health Organization website for the period 05-Jan to 17-Dec 2014.\nResults: We found significant differences in the growth patterns of EVD cases\nat the scale of the country, district, and other subnational administrative\ndivisions.

occasions under sample rotation where evolution of samples in time is designed
through a cascade pattern. It has been known since the seminal paper of
Patterson (1950) that when the units are not allowed to return to the sample
after leaving it for certain period (there are no gaps in the rotation
pattern), one step recursion for optimal estimator holds. However, in some
important real surveys, e.g. Current Population Survey in the US or Labour
Force Survey in many countries in Europe, units return to the sample after
being absent in the sample for several occasions (there are gaps in rotation
patterns). In such situations difficulty of the question of the form of the
recurrence for optimal estimator increases drastically. This issue has not been
resolved yet. Instead alternative sub-optimal approaches were developed, as
K-composite estimation (see e.g. Hansen et al. (1955)), AK-composite estimation
(see e.g. Gurney and Daly (1965) or time series approach (see e.g. Binder and
Hidiroglou (1988)).
  In the present paper we overcome this long-standing difficulty, that is, we
present analytical recursion formulas for the optimal linear estimator of the
mean for schemes with gaps in rotation patterns. It is achieved under some
technical conditions: ASSUMPTION I and ASSUMPTION II (numerical experiments
suggest that these assumptions might be universally satisfied). To attain the
goal we develop an algebraic operator approach which allows to reduce the
problem of recursion for the optimal linear estimator to two issues: (1)
localization of roots (possibly complex) of a polynomial Q_p defined in terms
of the rotation pattern (Q_p happens to be conveniently expressed through
Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind), (2) rank of a matrix S defined in

However, in some\nimportant real surveys, e.g. Current Population Survey in the US or Labour\nForce Survey in many countries in Europe, units return to the sample after\nbeing absent in the sample for several occasions (there are gaps in rotation\npatterns). In such situations difficulty of the question of the form of the\nrecurrence for optimal estimator increases drastically. This issue has not been\nresolved yet. Instead alternative sub-optimal approaches were developed, as\nK-composite estimation (see e.g. Hansen et al. (1955)), AK-composite estimation\n(see e.g. Gurney and Daly (1965) or time series approach (see e.g. Binder and\nHidiroglou (1988)).\n  In the present paper we overcome this long-standing difficulty, that is, we\npresent analytical recursion formulas for the optimal linear estimator of the\nmean for schemes with gaps in rotation patterns. It is achieved under some\ntechnical conditions: ASSUMPTION I and ASSUMPTION II (numerical experiments\nsuggest that these assumptions might be universally satisfied). To attain the\ngoal we develop an algebraic operator approach which allows to reduce the\nproblem of recursion for the optimal linear estimator to two issues: (1)\nlocalization of roots (possibly complex) of a polynomial Q_p defined in terms\nof the rotation pattern (Q_p happens to be conveniently expressed through\nChebyshev polynomials of the first kind), (2) rank of a matrix S defined in\nterms of the rotation pattern and the roots of the polynomial Q_p.'}","[{'name': 'Jan Kowalski'}, {'name': 'Jacek Wesolowski'}]",{'name': 'Jacek Wesolowski'},Jacek Wesolowski,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0995v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.0995v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'math.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'math.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.TH', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': '62D05, 62H12', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,,

southwest Florida and two hurricanes (Emily and Dean) on protected mangroves in
the Yucatan Peninsula were assessed paired sets of 20m multispectral SPOT and
16-day 500m MODIS images. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and
enhanced vegetation index (EVI) values were calculated to measure mangrove
canopy reflectance using three methods of analysis- 1) mangrove NDVI sample
point extraction, 2) qualitative assessment of 500m MODIS NDVI and EVI time
series, and 3) transects of NDVI differences before and after storm events.
Results show each method effectively captures changes in mangrove canopies
consistent with storm effects. However, the extent of damage to mangroves in
South Florida and Sian Ka'an was highly variable. Hurricanes Wilma and Katrina
produced a large drop in NDVI although NDVI values recovered within a year,
suggesting remarkable resilience. Hurricane Emily apparently increased mangrove
photosynthetic activity owing to the location of landfall relative to the study

loops at the highest temperatures normally achieved in the flare process. Their
ubiquity has led to their use as a standard measure of flare occurrence and
energy, although the overwhelming bulk of the total flare energy goes
elsewhere. Recently Dolla et al. (2012) noted quasi-periodic pulsations (QPP)
in the soft X-ray signature of the X-class flare SOL2011-02-15, as observed by
the standard photometric data from the GOES (Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite) spacecraft. In this paper we analyze the suitability
of the GOES data for this kind of analysis and find them to be generally
valuable after September, 2010 (GOES-15). We then extend the Dolla et al.
result to a complete list of X-class flares from Cycle 24, and show that most
of them (80%) display QPPs in the impulsive phase. The pulsations show up
cleanly in both channels of the GOES data, making use of time-series of
irradiance differences (the digital time derivative on the 2-s sampling). We
deploy different techniques to characterize the periodicity of GOES pulsations,
considering the red-noise properties of the flare signals, finding a range of
chracteristic time scales of the QPPs for each event, but usually with no
strong signature of a single period dominating in the power spectrum. The QPP
may also appear on somewhat longer time scales during the later gradual phase,
possibly with a greater tendency towards coherence, but the sampling noise in
GOES difference data for large irradiance values (X-class flares) makes these
more uncertain. We show that there is minimal phase difference between the
differenced GOES energy channels, or between them and the hard X-ray variations
on short time scales. During the impulsive phase the footpoints of the
newly-forming flare loops may also contribute to the observed soft X-ray
variations.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The soft X-ray emissions of solar flares come mainly from the bright coronal\nloops at the highest temperatures normally achieved in the flare process.

The key modeling tool is a\ngroup lasso with nested groups which guarantees that the sparsity pattern of\nlag coefficients honors the VAR's ordered structure. The HLag framework offers\nthree structures, which allow for varying levels of flexibility. A simulation\nstudy demonstrates improved performance in forecasting and lag order selection\nover previous approaches, and a macroeconomic application further highlights\nforecasting improvements as well as HLag's convenient, interpretable output.""}","[{'name': 'William B.

photometry of the helium atmosphere pulsating white dwarf (DBV) EC 04207-4748
obtained using the facilities at Mt John University Observatory in New Zealand.
The photometric data set consists of four week-long observing sessions covering
the period March to November 2011. A Fourier analysis of the lightcurves
yielded clear evidence of four independent eigenmodes in the star with the
dominant mode having a period of 447 s. The lightcurve variations exhibit
distinct nonsinusoidal shapes, which results in significant harmonics of the
dominant frequency appearing in the Fourier transforms. These observed
variations are interpreted in terms of nonlinear contributions from the energy
flux transmission through the subsurface convection zone in the star. Our
modelling of this mechanism, using the methods first introduced by Montgomery
(2005), yields a time-averaged convective response time of tau_0 ~ 150 s for
the star, and this is shown to be broadly consistent with a MLT/alpha parameter

A Fourier analysis of the lightcurves\nyielded clear evidence of four independent eigenmodes in the star with the\ndominant mode having a period of 447 s. The lightcurve variations exhibit\ndistinct nonsinusoidal shapes, which results in significant harmonics of the\ndominant frequency appearing in the Fourier transforms. These observed\nvariations are interpreted in terms of nonlinear contributions from the energy\nflux transmission through the subsurface convection zone in the star. Our\nmodelling of this mechanism, using the methods first introduced by Montgomery\n(2005), yields a time-averaged convective response time of tau_0 ~ 150 s for\nthe star, and this is shown to be broadly consistent with a MLT/alpha parameter\nvalue between 0.8 and 1.2.

more small things than large ones, e.g., far more small cities than large ones
in the world. This dramatic variation is often referred to as fractal or
scaling. To better reveal the fractal or scaling structure, a new
classification scheme, namely head/tail breaks, has been developed to
recursively derive different classes or hierarchical levels. The head/tail
breaks works as such: divide things into a few large ones in the head (those
above the average) and many small ones (those below the average) in the tail,
and recursively continue the dividing process for the large ones (or the head)
until the notion of far more small things than large ones has been violated.
This paper attempts to argue that head/tail breaks can be a powerful
visualization tool for illustrating structure and dynamics of natural cities.
Natural cities refer to naturally or objectively defined human settlements
based on a meaningful cutoff averaged from a massive amount of units extracted
from geographic information. To illustrate the effectiveness of head/tail
breaks in visualization, I have developed several case studies applied to
natural cities derived from the points of interest, social media location data,
and time series nighttime images. I further elaborate on head/tail breaks
related to fractals, beauty, and big data.

Medium Deep Survey (PS1 MDS) extragalactic sources into stochastic variables
(SV) and burst-like (BL) transients, using multi-band image-differencing
time-series data. We select detections in difference images associated with
galaxy hosts using a star/galaxy catalog extracted from the deep PS1 MDS
stacked images, and adopt a maximum a posteriori formulation to model their
difference-flux time-series in four Pan-STARRS1 photometric bands g,r,i, and z.
We use three deterministic light-curve models to fit burst-like transients and
one stochastic light curve model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, in order to
fit variability that is characteristic of active galactic nuclei (AGN). We
assess the quality of fit of the models band-wise source-wise, using their
estimated leave-out-one cross-validation likelihoods and corrected Akaike
information criteria. We then apply a K-means clustering algorithm on these
statistics, to determine the source classification in each band. The final

designing trustworthy systems, such as Sybil defenses, secure routing, and
anonymous/censorshipresilient communications. A key issue in the design of such
systems, is the revelation of users' trusted social contacts to an
adversary-information that is considered sensitive in today's society.
  In this work, we focus on the challenge of preserving the privacy of users'
social contacts, while still enabling the design of social trust based
applications. First, we propose LinkMirage, a community detection based
algorithm for anonymizing links in social network topologies; LinkMirage
preserves community structures in the social topology while anonymizing links
within the communities. LinkMirage considers the evolution of the social
network topologies, and minimizes privacy leakage due to temporal dynamics of
the system.
  Second, we define metrics for quantifying the privacy and utility of a time
series of social topologies with anonymized links. We analyze the privacy and
utility provided by LinkMirage both theoretically, as well as using real world
social network topologies: a Facebook dataset with 870K links and a large-scale
Google+ dataset with 940M links. We find that our approach significantly
outperforms the existing state-of-art.
  Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of LinkMirage in real-world

(TRBPs) have never been observed spectroscopically. Bright point properties
have not been compared with similar transition region and coronal structures.
In this work we have investigated three transient quiet Sun brightenings
including a TRBP, a coronal BP (CBP) and a blinker. We use time-series
observations of the extreme ultraviolet emission lines of a wide range of
temperature T (log T = 5.3 - 6.4) from the EUV imaging spectrometer (EIS)
onboard the Hinode satellite. We present the EIS temperature maps and Doppler
maps, which are compared with magnetograms from the Michelson Doppler Imager
(MDI) onboard the SOHO satellite. Doppler velocities of the TR BP and blinker
are <,25 km s$^{-1}$, which is typical of transient TR phenomena. The Dopper
velocities of the CBP were found to be < 20 km s^{-1} with exception of those
measured at log T = 6.2 where a distinct bi-directional jet is observed. From
an EM loci analysis we find evidence of single and double isothermal components
in the TRBP and CBP, respectively. TRBP and CBP loci curves are characterized
by broad distributions suggesting the existence of unresolved structure. By
comparing and contrasting the physical characteristics of the events we find
the BP phenomena are an indication of multi-scaled self similarity, given
similarities in both their underlying magnetic field configuration and
evolution in relation to EUV flux changes. In contrast, the blinker phenomena
and the TRBP are sufficiently dissimilar in their observed properties as to
constitute different event classes. Our work indicates that the measurement of
similar characteristics across multiple event types holds class-predictive

dynamic, dark, short-lived structures known as Rapid Redshifted and Blueshifted
Excursions (RREs, RBEs) that are on-disk absorption features observed in the
red and blue wings of spectral lines formed in the chromosphere. We study the

measuring the speed of the apparent motion, line-of-sight Doppler velocity, and

Furthermore, both types of structures either appear as high speed jets and
blobs that are directed outwardly from a magnetic bright point with speeds of
50 - 150 km/s, or emerge within a few seconds. A study of the different
velocity components suggests that the transverse motions along the
line-of-sight of the chromospheric flux tubes are responsible for the formation

and fast disappearance of the RREs/RBEs suggests that, similar to type II

variables, useful to understand the organization of a dynamical system. The
variables belonging to a relevant subset should have a strong integration with
the other variables of the same relevant subset, and a much weaker interaction
with the other system variables. On this basis, extending previous works on
neural networks, an information-theoretic measure is introduced, i.e. the
Dynamical Cluster Index, in order to identify good candidate relevant subsets.
The method does not require any previous knowledge of the relationships among
the system variables, but relies on observations of their values in time. We
show its usefulness in several application domains, including: (i) random
boolean networks, where the whole network is made of different subnetworks with
different topological relationships (independent or interacting subnetworks);
(ii) leader-follower dynamics, subject to noise and fluctuations; (iii)
catalytic reaction networks in a flow reactor; (iv) the MAPK signaling pathway
in eukaryotes. The validity of the method has been tested in cases where the
data are generated by a known dynamical model and the Dynamical Cluster Index
method is applied in order to uncover significant aspects of its organization;
however it is important to stress that it can also be applied to time series
coming from field data without any reference to a model. Given that it is based
on relative frequencies of sets of values, the method could be applied also to

On this basis, extending previous works on\nneural networks, an information-theoretic measure is introduced, i.e. the\nDynamical Cluster Index, in order to identify good candidate relevant subsets.\nThe method does not require any previous knowledge of the relationships among\nthe system variables, but relies on observations of their values in time. We\nshow its usefulness in several application domains, including: (i) random\nboolean networks, where the whole network is made of different subnetworks with\ndifferent topological relationships (independent or interacting subnetworks);\n(ii) leader-follower dynamics, subject to noise and fluctuations; (iii)\ncatalytic reaction networks in a flow reactor; (iv) the MAPK signaling pathway\nin eukaryotes. The validity of the method has been tested in cases where the\ndata are generated by a known dynamical model and the Dynamical Cluster Index\nmethod is applied in order to uncover significant aspects of its organization;\nhowever it is important to stress that it can also be applied to time series\ncoming from field data without any reference to a model.

larger average magnetic flux causing the line to become noticeably weaker. The

$\beta\gamma$ to $\beta\gamma\delta$ configuration over a period of 6 days. The
AR had two sub-regions of activity with opposite chirality: one dominated by
sunspot rotation producing a strong CME, the other showing large shear motions
producing a strong flare. The net current in each polarity over the CME
producing sub-region increased to a maximum and then decreased when the
sunspots got separated. The time profile of net current in this sub-region
followed the time profile of the rotation rate of the S-polarity sunspot of the

increase at the time of the strong flare and remained unchanged till the end of

cluster M68 (NGC 4590), using these to detect variable objects. We also
obtained electron-multiplying CCD (EMCCD) observations for this cluster in
order to explore its core with unprecedented spatial resolution from the
ground.
  We reduced our data using difference image analysis, in order to achieve the
best possible photometry in the crowded field of the cluster. In doing so, we
showed that when dealing with identical networked telescopes, a reference image
from any telescope may be used to reduce data from any other telescope, which
facilitates the analysis significantly. We then used our light curves to
estimate the properties of the RR Lyrae (RRL) stars in M68 through Fourier
decomposition and empirical relations. The variable star properties then
allowed us to derive the cluster's metallicity and distance.
  We determine new periods for the variable stars, and search for new
variables, especially in the core of the cluster where our method performs
particularly well. We detect an additional 4 SX Phe stars, and confirm the
variability of another star, bringing the total number of confirmed variable
stars in this cluster to 50. We also used archival data stretching back to 1951
in order to derive period changes for some of the single-mode RRL stars, and
analyse the significant number of double-mode RRL stars in M68. Furthermore, we
find evidence for double-mode pulsation in one of the SX Phe stars in this
cluster. Using the different types of variables, we derived an estimate of the
metallicity, [Fe/H]=$-2.07 \pm 0.06$ on the ZW scale, and 4 independent

detection around active stars by optimizing the use of Doppler Imaging in
radial velocity measurements. We propose a simple method to simultaneously
extract a brightness map and a set of orbital parameters through a tomographic
inversion technique derived from classical Doppler mapping. Based on the
maximum entropy principle, the underlying idea is to determine the set of
orbital parameters that minimizes the information content of the resulting
Doppler map. We carry out a set of numerical simulations to perform a
preliminary assessment of the robustness of our method, using an actual Doppler
map of the very active star HR 1099 to produce a realistic synthetic data set
for various sets of orbital parameters of a single planet in a circular orbit.
Using a simulated time-series of 50 line profiles affected by a peak-to-peak
activity jitter of 2.5 km/s, we are able in most cases to recover the radial
velocity amplitude, orbital phase and orbital period of an artificial planet
down to a radial velocity semi-amplitude of the order of the radial velocity
scatter due to the photon noise alone (about 50 m/s in our case). One
noticeable exception occurs when the planetary orbit is close to co-rotation,
in which case significant biases are observed in the reconstructed radial
velocity amplitude, while the orbital period and phase remain robustly
recovered. The present method constitutes a very simple way to extract orbital
parameters from heavily distorted line profiles of active stars, when more
classical radial velocity detection methods generally fail. It is easily
adaptable to most existing Doppler Imaging codes, paving the way towards a
systematic search for close-in planets orbiting young, rapidly-rotating stars.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': '(shortened for arXiv) We aim to progress towards more efficient exoplanet\ndetection around active stars by optimizing the use of Doppler Imaging in\nradial velocity measurements.

show that data gaps can significantly alter the precision of the regression
parameter estimation in the presence of colored noise, due to the frequency
leakage of the noise power. We present a regression method which cancels this
effect and estimates the parameters of interest with a precision comparable to

original image subtraction procedure exhibit many unusual outliers, and more
than 20% of data get rejected by the simple filtering algorithm adopted by
early analysis. In order to achieve better photometric precisions and also to
utilize all available data, the entire imaging database was re-analyzed with
our time-series photometry technique (Multi-aperture Indexing Photometry) and a
set of sophisticated calibration procedures. The merit of this approach is as
follows: we find an optimal aperture for each star with a maximum
signal-to-noise ratio, and also treat peculiar situations where photometry
returns misleading information with more optimal photometric index. We also
adopt photometric de-trending based on a hierarchical clustering method, which
is a very useful tool in removing systematics from light curves. Our method
removes systematic variations that are shared by light curves of nearby stars,
while true variabilities are preserved. Consequently, our method utilizes
nearly 100% of available data and reduce the rms scatter several times smaller

systems monitored with the Kepler spacecraft, Kepler-13A and HAT-P-7. For
Kepler-13A, we find $i_\star=81^\circ\pm5^\circ$ and $\psi=60^\circ\pm2^\circ$
adopting the spectroscopic constraint $\lambda=58.6^\circ\pm2.0^\circ$ by
Johnson et al. (2014). In our solution, the discrepancy between the above
$\lambda$ and that previously reported by Barnes et al. (2011) is solved by
fitting both of the two parameters in the quadratic limb-darkening law. We also
report the temporal variation in the orbital inclination of Kepler-13Ab,
$\mathrm{d} |\cos i_{\rm
orb}|/\mathrm{d}t=(-7.0\pm0.4)\times10^{-6}\,\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, providing
further evidence for the spin-orbit precession in this system. By fitting the
precession model to the time series of $i_{\rm orb}$, $\lambda$, and $i_\star$
obtained with the gravity-darkened model, we constrain the stellar quadrupole
moment $J_2=(6.1\pm0.3)\times10^{-5}$ for our new solution, which is several
times smaller than $J_2=(1.66\pm0.08)\times10^{-4}$ obtained for the previous

$\lambda$, thus providing a possibility to test our solution with follow-up

We also\nreport the temporal variation in the orbital inclination of Kepler-13Ab,\n$\\mathrm{d} |\\cos i_{\\rm\norb}|/\\mathrm{d}t=(-7.0\\pm0.4)\\times10^{-6}\\,\\mathrm{day}^{-1}$, providing\nfurther evidence for the spin-orbit precession in this system. By fitting the\nprecession model to the time series of $i_{\\rm orb}$, $\\lambda$, and $i_\\star$\nobtained with the gravity-darkened model, we constrain the stellar quadrupole\nmoment $J_2=(6.1\\pm0.3)\\times10^{-5}$ for our new solution, which is several\ntimes smaller than $J_2=(1.66\\pm0.08)\\times10^{-4}$ obtained for the previous\none. We show that the difference can be observable in the future evolution of\n$\\lambda$, thus providing a possibility to test our solution with follow-up\nobservations. The second target, HAT-P-7, is the first F-dwarf star analyzed\nwith the gravity-darkening method. Our analysis points to a nearly pole-on\nconfiguration with $\\psi=101^\\circ\\pm2^\\circ$ or $87^\\circ\\pm2^\\circ$ and the\ngravity-darkening exponent $\\beta$ consistent with $0.25$.

It was compared to the\nmean, median, and a previously proposed Expectation Maximization (EM) label\naggregation approaches. While accurately predicting each labelling algorithm's\nbias and precision, the root-mean-square error of the BCLA was\n11.78$\\pm$0.63ms, significantly outperforming the best Challenge entry\n(15.37$\\pm$2.13ms) as well as the EM, mean, and median voting strategies\n(14.76$\\pm$0.52ms, 17.61$\\pm$0.55ms, and 14.43$\\pm$0.57ms respectively with\n$p<0.0001$).""}","[{'name': 'Tingting Zhu'}, {'name': 'Nic Dunkley'}, {'name': 'Joachim Behar'}, {'name': 'David A.

concept of state-space reconstruction, this set of methods allows us to compute
characteristic quantities such as Lyapunov exponents and fractal dimensions, to
predict the future course of the time series, and even to reconstruct the

finite-precision arithmetic, among other things. Even so, nonlinear time-series
analysis has been used to great advantage on thousands of real and synthetic

series consists in the fact that the model is formulated such that the
stochastic process under the null hypothesis of ""no change-point"" is
stationary. This assumption is crucial to derive (asymptotic) critical values
for the corresponding testing procedures using an elegant and powerful
mathematical theory, but it might be not very realistic from a practical point
of view.
  This paper develops change point analysis under less restrictive assumptions
and deals with the problem of detecting change points in the marginal variance
and correlation structures of a non-stationary time series. A CUSUM approach is
proposed, which is used to test the ""classical"" hypothesis of the form $H_0:
\theta_1=\theta_2$ vs. $H_1: \theta_1 \not =\theta_2$, where $\theta_1$ and
$\theta_2$ denote second order parameters of the process before and after a
change point. The asymptotic distribution of the CUSUM test statistic is
derived under the null hypothesis. This distribution depends in a complicated
way on the dependency structure of the nonlinear non-stationary time series and
a bootstrap approach is developed to generate critical values. The results are
then extended to test the hypothesis of a {\it non relevant change point}, i.e.
$H_0: | \theta_1-\theta_2 | \leq \delta$, which reflects the fact that
inference should not be changed, if the difference between the parameters
before and after the change-point is small.
  In contrast to previous work, our approach does neither require the mean to
be constant nor - in the case of testing for lag $k$-correlation - that the
mean, variance and fourth order joint cumulants are constant under the null

This assumption is crucial to derive (asymptotic) critical values\nfor the corresponding testing procedures using an elegant and powerful\nmathematical theory, but it might be not very realistic from a practical point\nof view.\n  This paper develops change point analysis under less restrictive assumptions\nand deals with the problem of detecting change points in the marginal variance\nand correlation structures of a non-stationary time series. A CUSUM approach is\nproposed, which is used to test the ""classical"" hypothesis of the form $H_0:\n\\theta_1=\\theta_2$ vs. $H_1: \\theta_1 \\not =\\theta_2$, where $\\theta_1$ and\n$\\theta_2$ denote second order parameters of the process before and after a\nchange point. The asymptotic distribution of the CUSUM test statistic is\nderived under the null hypothesis. This distribution depends in a complicated\nway on the dependency structure of the nonlinear non-stationary time series and\na bootstrap approach is developed to generate critical values. The results are\nthen extended to test the hypothesis of a {\\it non relevant change point}, i.e.\n$H_0: | \\theta_1-\\theta_2 | \\leq \\delta$, which reflects the fact that\ninference should not be changed, if the difference between the parameters\nbefore and after the change-point is small.\n  In contrast to previous work, our approach does neither require the mean to\nbe constant nor - in the case of testing for lag $k$-correlation - that the\nmean, variance and fourth order joint cumulants are constant under the null\nhypothesis.

photometric or radial velocity time series, as presented by ESA's Gaia mission.
Periodicity detection hinges on the estimation of the false alarm probability
(FAP) of the extremum of the periodogram of the time series. We consider the
problem of its estimation with two main issues in mind. First, for a given
number of observations and signal-to-noise ratio, the rate of correct
periodicity detections should be constant for all realized cadences of
observations regardless of the observational time patterns, in order to avoid
sky biases that are difficult to assess. Second, the computational loads should
be kept feasible even for millions of time series. Using the Gaia case, we
compare the $F^M$ method (Paltani 2004, Schwarzenberg-Czerny 2012), the Baluev
method (Baluev 2008) and the GEV method (S\""uveges 2014), as well as a method
for the direct estimation of a threshold. Three methods involve some unknown
parameters, which are obtained by fitting a regression-type predictive model
using easily obtainable covariates derived from observational time series. We
conclude that the GEV and the Baluev methods both provide good solutions to the
issues posed by a large-scale processing. The first of these yields the best
scientific quality at the price of some moderately costly pre-processing. When
this pre-processing is impossible for some reason (e.g. the computational costs
are prohibitive or good regression models cannot be constructed), the Baluev
method provides a computationally inexpensive alternative with slight biases in
regions where time samplings exhibit strong aliases.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We study the problem of periodicity detection in massive data sets of\nphotometric or radial velocity time series, as presented by ESA\'s Gaia mission.\nPeriodicity detection hinges on the estimation of the false alarm probability\n(FAP) of the extremum of the periodogram of the time series.

emission in the presence of a large thermal background) can be problematic due
to an unfavorable signal-to-noise ratio. An approach is presented to use
time-series spectroscopy to separate non-equilibrium quantities from slowly
varying equilibria. A stochastic process associated with the non-equilibrium
part of the spectrum is characterized in terms of its central moments or
cumulants, which may vary over time. This parameterization encodes information
about the non-equilibrium behavior of the system.
  Stochastic time-series spectroscopy (STSS) can be implemented at very little
expense in many settings since a series of scans are typically recorded in

may be readily calculated from this series, enabling the observation of
quantities that would be difficult or impossible to determine from an average
spectrum or from prinicipal components analysis (PCA).
  This method is more scalable than PCA, having linear time complexity, yet it
can produce comparable or superior results, as shown in example applications.
One example compares an STSS-derived CO$_2$ bending mode to a standard
reference spectrum and the result of PCA. A second example shows that STSS can
reveal conditions of stress in rocks, a scenario where traditional methods such
as PCA are inadequate. This allows spectral lines and non-equilibrium behavior
to be precisely resolved. A relationship between 2nd order STSS and a

rate of solar spots is directly related to magnetic diffusivity, which itself
is a key quantity for the length of a magnetic-activity cycle. Is a linear spot
decay also seen on other stars, and is this in agreement with the large range
of solar and stellar activity cycle lengths? We investigate the evolution of
starspots on the rapidly-rotating ($P_{\rm rot}$ $\approx$ 24 d) K0 giant XX
Tri, using consecutive time-series Doppler images. Our aim is to obtain a
well-sampled movie of the stellar surface over many years, and thereby detect
and quantify a starspot decay law for further comparison with the Sun. We
obtained continuous high-resolution and phase-resolved spectroscopy with the
1.2-m robotic STELLA telescope on Tenerife over six years. For each observing
season, we obtained between 5 to 7 independent Doppler images, one per stellar
rotation, making up a total of 36 maps. To quantify starspot area decay and
growth, we match the observed images with simplified spot models based on a
Monte Carlo approach. It is shown that the surface of XX Tri is covered with
large high-latitude and even polar spots and with occasional small equatorial
spots. Just over the course of six years, we see a systematically changing spot
distribution with various timescales and morphology, such as spot fragmentation
and spot merging as well as spot decay and formation. An average linear decay
of $D$ = $-$0.022 $\pm$ 0.002 SH/day is inferred. We found evidence of an
active longitude in phase toward the (unseen) companion star. Furthermore, we
detect a weak solar-like differential rotation with a surface shear of $\alpha$

understood. Coronal rain is the fall of cool and dense blobs formed by thermal
instability in the solar corona towards the solar surface with acceleration
smaller than gravitational free fall. We aim to study the observational
evidence of the formation of coronal rain and to trace the detailed dynamics of
individual blobs. We used time series of the 171 \AA\, and 304 \AA\, spectral
lines obtained by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar
Dynamic Observatory (SDO) above active region AR 11420 on February 22, 2012.
Observations show that a coronal loop disappeared in the 171 \AA\ channel and
appeared in the 304 \AA\ line$\text{}\text{}$ more than one hour later, which
indicates a rapid cooling of the coronal loop from 1 MK to 0.05 MK. An energy
estimation shows that the radiation is higher than the heat input, which
indicates so-called catastrophic cooling. The cooling was accompanied by the
formation of coronal rain in the form of falling cold plasma. We studied two
different sequences of falling blobs. The first sequence includes three
different blobs. The mean velocities of the blobs were estimated to be 50 km
s$^{-1}$, 60 km s$^{-1}$ and 40 km s$^{-1}$. A polynomial fit shows the
different values of the acceleration for different blobs, which are lower than
free-fall in the solar corona. The first and second blob move along the same
path, but with and without acceleration, respectively. We performed simple
numerical simulations for two consecutive blobs, which show that the second
blob moves in a medium that is modified by the passage of the first blob.
Therefore, the second blob has a relatively high speed and no acceleration, as
is shown by observations. The second sequence includes two different blobs with
mean velocities of 100 km s$^{-1}$ and 90 km s$^{-1}$, respectively.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The formation and dynamics of coronal rain are currently not fully\nunderstood.

in the pattern of information flow between subsystems of a complex network.
Methods: The presence of redundancy and/or synergy in multivariate time series
data renders difficult to estimate the neat flow of information from each
driver variable to a given target. We show that adopting an unnormalized
definition of Granger causality one may put in evidence redundant multiplets of
variables influencing the target by maximizing the total Granger causality to a
given target, over all the possible partitions of the set of driving variables.
Consequently we introduce a pairwise index of synergy which is zero when two
independent sources additively influence the future state of the system,
differently from previous definitions of synergy. Results: We report the
application of the proposed approach to resting state fMRI data from the Human
Connectome Project, showing that redundant pairs of regions arise mainly due to
space contiguity and interhemispheric symmetry, whilst synergy occurs mainly
between non-homologous pairs of regions in opposite hemispheres. Conclusions:
Redundancy and synergy, in healthy resting brains, display characteristic
patterns, revealed by the proposed approach. Significance: The pairwise synergy

has been the detection of powerful flares from the Crab Nebula. These flares
challenge our understanding of pulsar wind nebulae and models for particle
acceleration. We report on the portion of a multiwavelength campaign using
Keck, HST, and Chandra concentrating on a small emitting region, the Crab's
inner knot, located a fraction of an arcsecond from the pulsar.
  We find that the knot's radial size, tangential size, peak flux, and the
ratio of the flux to that of the pulsar are correlated with the projected
distance of the knot from the pulsar. A new approach, using singular value
decomposition for analyzing time series of images, was introduced yielding
results consistent with the more traditional methods while some uncertainties
were substantially reduced.
  We exploit the characterization of the knot to discuss constraints on
standard shock-model parameters that may be inferred from our observations
assuming the inner knot lies near to the shocked surface. These include
inferences as to wind magnetization, shock shape parameters such as incident
angle and poloidal radius of curvature, as well as the IR/optical emitting
particle enthalpy fraction. We find that while the standard shock model gives
good agreement with observation in many respects, there remain two puzzles: (a)
The observed angular size of the knot relative to the pulsar--knot separation

field of view (30' across in full field mode) of the X-ray cameras on board the
European Space Agency X-ray observatory XMM-Newton, each individual pointing
can result in the detection of hundreds of X-ray sources, most of which are
newly discovered. Recently, many improvements in the XMM-Newton data reduction
algorithms have been made. These include enhanced source characterisation and
reduced spurious source detections, refined astrometric precision, greater net
sensitivity and the extraction of spectra and time series for fainter sources,
with better signal-to-noise. Further, almost 50\% more observations are in the
public domain compared to 2XMMi-DR3, allowing the XMM-Newton Survey Science
Centre (XMM-SSC) to produce a much larger and better quality X-ray source
catalogue. The XMM-SSC has developed a pipeline to reduce the XMM-Newton data
automatically and using improved calibration a new catalogue version has been
produced from XMM-Newton data made public by 2013 Dec. 31 (13 years of data).
Manual screening ensures the highest data quality. This catalogue is known as
3XMM. In the latest release, 3XMM-DR5, there are 565962 X-ray detections
comprising 396910 unique X-ray sources. For the 133000 brightest sources,
spectra and lightcurves are provided. For all detections, the positions on the
sky, a measure of the quality of the detection, and an evaluation of the X-ray
variability is provided, along with the fluxes and count rates in 7 X-ray
energy bands, the total 0.2-12 keV band counts, and four hardness ratios. To
identify the detections, a cross correlation with 228 catalogues is also

methods to quantify the long-term correlations in nonstationary time series.
Many long-term correlated time series in real systems contain various trends.
We investigate the effects of polynomial trends on the scaling behaviors and
the performances of three widely used DMA methods including backward algorithm
(BDMA), centered algorithm (CDMA) and forward algorithm (FDMA). We derive a
general framework for polynomial trends and obtain analytical results for
constant shifts and linear trends. We find that the behavior of the CDMA method
is not influenced by constant shifts. In contrast, linear trends cause a
crossover in the CDMA fluctuation functions. We also find that constant shifts
and linear trends cause crossovers in the fluctuation functions obtained from
the BDMA and FDMA methods. When a crossover exists, the scaling behavior at
small scales comes from the intrinsic time series while that at large scales is
dominated by the constant shifts or linear trends. We also derive analytically
the expressions of crossover scales and show that the crossover scale depends
on the strength of the polynomial trend, the Hurst index, and in some cases
(linear trends for BDMA and FDMA) the length of the time series. In all cases,
the BDMA and the FDMA behave almost the same under the influence of constant
shifts or linear trends. Extensive numerical experiments confirm excellently
the analytical derivations. We conclude that the CDMA method outperforms the

then reveals frequency differences of dominant modes in the periodogram of the

clustering (KSC), an approach to clustering cast within a kernel-based
optimization setting. KSC represents a least-squares support vector machine
based formulation of spectral clustering described by a weighted kernel PCA
objective. Just as in the classifier case, the binary clustering model is
expressed by a hyperplane in a high dimensional space induced by a kernel. In
addition, the multi-way clustering can be obtained by combining a set of binary
decision functions via an Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) encoding scheme.
Because of its model-based nature, the KSC method encompasses three main steps:
training, validation, testing. In the validation stage model selection is
performed to obtain tuning parameters, like the number of clusters present in
the data. This is a major advantage compared to classical spectral clustering
where the determination of the clustering parameters is unclear and relies on
heuristics. Once a KSC model is trained on a small subset of the entire data,
it is able to generalize well to unseen test points. Beyond the basic
formulation, sparse KSC algorithms based on the Incomplete Cholesky

the longitudes and radii of the two spots within 5-day windows of data. Within
each window of time the starspots are assumed to be unchanging. Only a weak

The availability of asteroseismic constraints for a large sample of
red giant stars from the CoRoT and Kepler missions paves the way for various
statistical studies of the seismic properties of stellar populations.
  Aims. We use the first detailed spectroscopic study of 19 CoRoT red-giant
stars (Morel et al 2014) to compare theoretical stellar evolution models to
observations of the open cluster NGC 6633 and field stars.
  Methods. In order to explore the effects of rotation-induced mixing and
thermohaline instability, we compare surface abundances of carbon isotopic
ratio and lithium with stellar evolution predictions. These chemicals are
sensitive to extra-mixing on the red-giant branch.
  Results. We estimate mass, radius, and distance for each star using the
seismic constraints. We note that the Hipparcos and seismic distances are
different. However, the uncertainties are such that this may not be
significant. Although the seismic distances for the cluster members are self
consistent they are somewhat larger than the Hipparcos distance. This is an
issue that should be considered elsewhere. Models including thermohaline
instability and rotation-induced mixing, together with the seismically
determined masses can explain the chemical properties of red-giants targets.
However, with this sample of stars we cannot perform stringent tests of the
current stellar models. Tighter constraints on the physics of the models would
require the measurement of the core and surface rotation rates, and of the
period spacing of gravity-dominated mixed modes. A larger number of stars with
longer times series, as provided by Kepler or expected with Plato, would help
for ensemble asteroseismology.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Context.

applications as well as its theory. Change point analysis is a statistical tool
that aims to attain homogeneity within time series data. This is accomplished
through partitioning the time series into a number of contiguous homogeneous
segments. The applications of such techniques range from identifying chromosome
alterations to solar flare detection. In this manuscript we present a general
purpose search algorithm called cp3o that can be used to identify change points
in multivariate time series. This new search procedure can be applied with a
large class of goodness of fit measures. Additionally, a reduction in the
computational time needed to identify change points is accomplish by means of
probabilistic pruning. With mild assumptions about the goodness of fit measure
this new search algorithm is shown to generate consistent estimates for both
the number of change points and their locations, even when the number of change
points increases with the time series length.

that the e-cp3o procedure makes is that the absolute $\alpha$th moment exists,

the dynamics of a system from its observed time series is key to the prediction

due to external disturbances or sudden changes in the intrinsic dynamics, are

statistical patterns of a time series change, pose considerable challenges to
data analysis. Without identification of such break points, the same dynamic

cast the problem of decomposing a time series into its trend and seasonal

arbitrariness in the number of parameters. To overcome this difficulty, we
propose the addition of a penalty function (i.e., a regularization term) that

seasonality and trend without the need of iterations, and allows the reliable

regeneration of magnetic fields by the dynamo action. We propose a new method
to analyze the daily sunspot areas data recorded since 1874. By computing the
power spectral density of daily data series using the Mexican hat wavelet, we
found a power spectrum with a well-defined shape, characterized by three
features. The first term is the 22 yr solar magnetic cycle, estimated in our
work to be of 18.43 yr. The second term is related to the daily volatility of
sunspots. This term is most likely produced by the turbulent motions linked to
the solar granulation. The last term corresponds to a periodic source
associated with the solar magnetic activity, for which the maximum of power

to strongly impact the radial velocity time series. It then limits the
detection of small planetary RV signals (eg, an Earth-mass planet in the
habitable zone of a solar-like star). In previous papers, we studied the
detectability of such planets around the Sun seen as an edge-on star. For that
purpose, we computed the RV and photometric variations induced by solar
magnetic activity, using all active structures observed over one entire cycle.
Our goal is to perform similar studies on stars with different physical and
geometrical properties. As a first step, we focus on Sun-like stars seen with
various inclinations, and on estimating detection capabilities with forthcoming
instruments. To do so, we first parameterize the solar active structures with
the most realistic pattern so as to obtain results consistent with the observed
ones. We simulate the growth, evolution and decay of solar spots, faculae and
network, using parameters and empiric laws derived from solar observations and
literature. We generate the corresponding structure lists over a full solar
cycle. We then build the resulting spectra and deduce the RV and photometric
variations for a `Sun' seen with various inclinations. The produced RV signal
takes into account the photometric contribution of structures as well as the
attenuation of the convective blueshift. The comparison between our simulated
activity pattern and the observed one validates our model. We show that the
inclination of the stellar rotation axis has a significant impact on the time
series. RV long-term amplitudes as well as short-term jitters are significantly
reduced when going from edge-on to pole-on configurations. Assuming spin-orbit
alignment, the optimal configuration for planet detection is an inclined star

As a first step, we focus on Sun-like stars seen with\nvarious inclinations, and on estimating detection capabilities with forthcoming\ninstruments. To do so, we first parameterize the solar active structures with\nthe most realistic pattern so as to obtain results consistent with the observed\nones. We simulate the growth, evolution and decay of solar spots, faculae and\nnetwork, using parameters and empiric laws derived from solar observations and\nliterature. We generate the corresponding structure lists over a full solar\ncycle. We then build the resulting spectra and deduce the RV and photometric\nvariations for a `Sun' seen with various inclinations. The produced RV signal\ntakes into account the photometric contribution of structures as well as the\nattenuation of the convective blueshift. The comparison between our simulated\nactivity pattern and the observed one validates our model. We show that the\ninclination of the stellar rotation axis has a significant impact on the time\nseries. RV long-term amplitudes as well as short-term jitters are significantly\nreduced when going from edge-on to pole-on configurations. Assuming spin-orbit\nalignment, the optimal configuration for planet detection is an inclined star\n(i~45{\\deg}).""}","[{'name': 'Simon Borgniet'}, {'name': 'Nadège Meunier'}, {'name': 'Anne-Marie Lagrange'}]",{'name': 'Anne-Marie Lagrange'},Anne-Marie Lagrange,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201425007', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07361v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.07361v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'astro-ph.SR', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",10.1051/0004-6361/201425007,"A&A 581, A133 (2015)","Accepted to Astronomy and Astrophysics on May, 27th 2015.

The origin of these metals is almost certainly the circumstellar disc of dusty
and gaseous debris from a tidally-disrupted planetesimal, accreting at a rate
of 1.6E10 gs^-1. Studying the chemical abundances of the accreted material
demonstrates that the planetesimal had a composition similar to the Earth,
dominated by rocky silicates and metallic iron, with a low water content. The
mass of metals within the convection zone of the white dwarf corresponds to an
asteroid of at least ~130-170 km in diameter, although the presence of ongoing
accretion from the debris disc implies that the planetesimal was probably
larger than this. While a previous abundance study of the accreted material has
shown an anomalously high mass fraction of carbon (15 percent) compared to the
bulk Earth, our independent analysis results in a carbon abundance of just 2.5
percent. Enhanced abundances of core material (Fe, Ni) suggest that the
accreted object may have lost a portion of its mantle, possibly due to stellar

the important bright phases in the evolution of SN 2014J during the period from
January 24 to April 1 of 2014. The spectral evolution of SN 2014J is derived
empirically. The expansion velocities of the Si II P-Cygni features were

velocity of 14,000 km/s on January 24. The Ca II infrared triplet feature shows
a high velocity component with expansion velocities of > 20, 000 km/s during

of Ca II, Mg II and Fe II. The TIGRE SN 2014J spectra also resolve several very
sharp Na I D doublet absorption components. Our analysis suggests interesting

data processing of two subgiants of spectral type G: KIC 6442183 and KIC

$\mu$Hz for KIC 6442183, $\Delta\nu=65.5\pm 0.2 $ $\mu$Hz and $\nu_{\rm

extract the individual mode frequencies of the two stars. We compare stellar
models and observations, including mode frequencies and mode inertias. The mode
inertias of mixed modes, which are sensitive to the stellar interior, are used
to constrain stellar models. We define a quantity $d\nu_{\rm m-p}$ that
measures the difference between the mixed modes and the expected pure pressure
modes, which is related to the inertia ratio of mixed modes to radial modes.

  Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is used in geophysics to

in time thank to the regular SAR image acquisitions by dedicated satellites.
The main limitation of the technique is the atmospheric disturbances that
affect the radar signal while traveling from the sensor to the ground and back.
In this paper, we propose to use the Allan variance for analyzing spatial data

in radial mode for detecting different types of behavior for different

integration time in the classical time and frequency application. We found that
radial AVAR is the more appropriate way to have an estimator insensitive to the
spatial axis and we applied it on SAR data acquired over eastern Turkey for the

classically found in InSAR such as phase decorrelation producing white noise or

We show that sentiment polarity of\nTwitter peaks implies the direction of cumulative abnormal returns.

a wide range of timescales. The short, coherent variations, with frequencies
above 1 Hz, are referred to as quasi-periodic oscillations, and are generally
explained by resonant effects in the black hole accretion flow. The purely
stochastic variability that occurs due to turbulent conditions in the plasma,
is quantified by the power density spectra and appears practically in all types
of sources and their spectral states. The specific kind of quasi-periodic
flares is expected, when the global structure of the accretion flow, governed

variability in the sense of deterministic chaos. We study the nonlinear

quantitatively the indications for deterministic chaos, such as the Renyi's

subsets of possible predictors should be tested for their predictive power, but

thus mitigate the effects of these activity-induced nuisance signals. This is
expected to be a major obstacle to using next-generation spectrographs to
detect lower mass planets, planets with longer periods, and planets around more
active stars. Enter Gaussian processes (GPs) which, we note, have a number of

been proposed to quantify the strength of cross-correlations on different
temporal scales in bivariate, non-stationary time series. It is based on the
detrended cross-correlation and detrended fluctuation analyses (DCCA and DFA,
respectively) and can be viewed as an analogue of the Pearson coefficient in
the case of the fluctuation analysis. The coefficient $\rho_{\rm DCCA}$ works
well in many practical situations but by construction its applicability is
limited to detection of whether two signals are generally cross-correlated,
without possibility to obtain information on the amplitude of fluctuations that
are responsible for those cross-correlations. In order to introduce some
related flexibility, here we propose an extension of $\rho_{\rm DCCA}$ that
exploits the multifractal versions of DFA and DCCA: MFDFA and MFCCA,
respectively. The resulting new coefficient $\rho_q$ not only is able to
quantify the strength of correlations, but also it allows one to identify the
range of detrended fluctuation amplitudes that are correlated in two signals
under study. We show how the coefficient $\rho_q$ works in practical situations
by applying it to stochastic time series representing processes with long
memory: autoregressive and multiplicative ones. Such processes are often used
to model signals recorded from complex systems and complex physical phenomena
like turbulence, so we are convinced that this new measure can successfully be
applied in time series analysis. In particular, we present an example of such
application to highly complex empirical data from financial markets. The

dynamics of a dynamical system is studied. Local bifurcations are characterised
by a single or a pair of characteristic exponents crossing the imaginary axis.
The approach of such bifurcations in the presence of noise can be inferred from
the slowing down of the correlation decay. On the other hand, little is known
about global bifurcations involving high-dimensional attractors with positive
Lyapunov exponents.
  The global stability of chaotic attractors may be characterised by the
spectral properties of the Koopman or the transfer operators governing the
evolution of statistical ensembles. It has recently been shown that a boundary
crisis in the Lorenz flow coincides with the approach to the unit circle of the
eigenvalues of these operators associated with motions about the attractor, the
stable resonances. A second type of resonances, the unstable resonances, is
responsible for the decay of correlations and mixing on the attractor. In the
deterministic case, those cannot be expected to be affected by general boundary
crises.
  Here, however, we give an example of chaotic system in which slowing down of
the decay of correlations of some observables does occur at the approach of a
boundary crisis. The system considered is a high-dimensional, chaotic climate
model of physical relevance. Moreover, coarse-grained approximations of the
transfer operators on a reduced space, constructed from a long time series of
the system, give evidence that this behaviour is due to the approach of
unstable resonances to the unit circle. That the unstable resonances are
affected by the crisis can be physically understood from the fact that the

We find the short-term\nvariability to be intermittent, but present throughout the majority of the time\nseries, though its occurrence and amplitude are uncorrelated with the longer\ncycle. These essentially solar-like variations occur in a Sun-like star with\nmore rapid rotation, though surface differential rotation measurements leave\nopen the possibility of a solar equivalence.'}","[{'name': 'Ricky Egeland'}, {'name': 'Travis S.

We construct two recursive\nfilters for online estimation of the parameter vectors based on proximal\noptimization techniques, as well as a novel filter for recursive computation of\nstatistical confidence regions. Simulation studies reveal that our algorithms\noutperform several existing point process filters in terms of trackability,\ngoodness-of-fit and mean square error. We finally apply our filtering\nalgorithms to experimentally recorded spiking data from the ferret primary\nauditory cortex during attentive behavior in a click rate discrimination task.\nOur analysis provides new insights into the time-course of the spectrotemporal\nreceptive field plasticity of the auditory neurons.'}","[{'name': 'Alireza Sheikhattar'}, {'name': 'Jonathan B.

stochastic mortality using extended CreditRisk$^+$ methodology which is very
different from traditional time series methods used for mortality modelling
previously. In this framework, deaths are driven by common latent stochastic
risk factors which may be interpreted as death causes like neoplasms,
circulatory diseases or idiosyncratic components. These common factors
introduce dependence between policyholders in annuity portfolios or between
death events in population. This framework can be used to construct life tables
based on mortality rate forecast. Moreover this framework allows stress testing
and, therefore, offers insight into how certain health scenarios influence
annuity payments of an insurer. Such scenarios may include improvement in
health treatments or better medication. In this paper, using publicly available
data for Australia, we estimate the model using Markov chain Monte Carlo method
to identify leading death causes across all age groups including long term
forecast for 2031 and 2051. On top of general reduced mortality, the proportion
of deaths for certain certain causes has changed massively over the period 1987
to 2011. Our model forecasts suggest that if these trends persist, then the
future gives a whole new picture of mortality for people aged above 40 years.
Neoplasms will become the overall number-one death cause. Moreover, deaths due
to mental and behavioural disorders are very likely to surge whilst deaths due
to circulatory diseases will tend to decrease. This potential increase in
deaths due to mental and behavioural disorders for older ages will have a

of $\eta$ Carinae collected via SMARTS observations using the CTIO 1.5 m
telescope and echelle spectrograph. Our observations were made almost every
night over a two-month interval around the photometric minimum of $\eta$ Car
associated with the periastron passage of a hot companion. The photoionizing
flux of the companion and heating related to colliding winds causes large
changes in the wind properties of the massive primary star. Here we present an
analysis of temporal variations in a sample of spectral lines that are clearly
formed in the wind of the primary star. These lines are affected by a changing
illumination of the flux of the secondary star during the periastron passage.
We document the sudden onset of blue-shifted absorption that occurred in most
of the lines near or slightly after periastron, and we argue that these
absorption components are seen when we view the relatively undisturbed wind of
the foreground primary star. We present time series measurements of the net
equivalent width of the wind lines and of the radial velocities of the
absorption trough minima and the emission peak midpoints. Most lines decrease
in emission strength around periastron, and those high excitation lines formed
close to the primary exhibit a red-ward velocity excursion. We show how these
trends can be explained using an illuminated hemisphere model that is based on

series of 171, 304, 193 and 211 {\AA} spectral lines obtained by Solar Dynamics
Observatory/ Atmospheric Imaging Assembly during 2012 November 7-8. The tornado
first appeared at 08:00 UT, November 07, near the surface, gradually rose
upwards with the mean speed of $\sim$ 1.5 km s$^{-1}$ and persisted over 30 hr.
Time-distance plots show two patterns of quasi-periodic transverse
displacements of the tornado axis with periods of 40 and 50 minute at different
phases of the tornado evolution. The first pattern occurred during the rising
phase and can be explained by the upward motion of the twisted tornado. The
second pattern occurred during the later stage of evolution when the tornado
already stopped rising and could be caused either by MHD kink waves in the
tornado or by the rotation of two tornado threads around a common axis. The
later hypothesis is supported by the fact that the tornado sometimes showed a
double structure during the quasi-periodic phase. 211 and 193 {\AA} spectral
lines show a coronal cavity above the prominence/tornado, which started
expansion at $\sim$ 13:00 UT and continuously rose above the solar limb. The
tornado finally became unstable and erupted together with the corresponding
prominence as coronal mass ejection (CME) at 15:00 UT, November 08. The final
stage of the evolution of the cavity and the tornado-related prominence
resembles the magnetic breakout model. On the other hand, the kink instability
may destabilize the twisted tornado, and consequently prominence tornadoes can
be used as precursors for CMEs.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We study the detailed dynamics of a solar prominence tornado using time\nseries of 171, 304, 193 and 211 {\\AA} spectral lines obtained by Solar Dynamics\nObservatory/ Atmospheric Imaging Assembly during 2012 November 7-8.

modeling the joint dynamics of macroeconomic time series as well as
forecasting. A major shortcoming of the VAR that has hindered its applicability
is its heavy parameterization: the parameter space grows quadratically with the
number of series included, quickly exhausting the available degrees of freedom.
Consequently, forecasting using VARs is intractable for low-frequency,
high-dimensional macroeconomic data. However, empirical evidence suggests that
VARs that incorporate more component series tend to result in more accurate
forecasts. Conventional methods that allow for the estimation of large VARs
either tend to require ad hoc subjective specifications or are computationally
infeasible. Moreover, as global economies become more intricately intertwined,
there has been substantial interest in incorporating the impact of stochastic,
unmodeled exogenous variables. Vector autoregression with exogenous variables
(VARX) extends the VAR to allow for the inclusion of unmodeled variables, but
it similarly faces dimensionality challenges.
  We introduce the VARX-L framework, a structured family of VARX models, and
provide methodology that allows for both efficient estimation and accurate
forecasting in high-dimensional analysis. VARX-L adapts several prominent
scalar regression regularization techniques to a vector time series context in
order to greatly reduce the parameter space of VAR and VARX models. We also
highlight a compelling extension that allows for shrinking toward reference

decades, a lot of efforts has been put into the understanding of limit theory

weakly dependent sequences (Dedecker et al. [21]), long-range dependent

relations between the convergence of point processes, sums and maxima, see also
Resnick [51] for a recent account. He advocated the use of multivariate regular
variation as a flexible tool to describe heavy-tail phenomena combined with
advanced continuous mapping techniques. For example, maxima and sums are
understood as functionals acting on an underlying point process, if the point
process converges these functionals converge as well and their limits are
described in terms of the points of the limiting point process. Davis and Hsing
[13] recognized the power of this approach for limit theory of point processes,
maxima, sums, and large deviations for dependent regularly varying processes,
i.e., stationary sequences whose finite-dimensional distributions are regularly
varying with the same index. Before [13], limit theory for particular regularly
varying stationary sequences was studied for the sample mean, maxima, sample
autocovariance and autocorrelation functions of linear and bilinear processes

extending from +1 to +461 days after shock breakout, estimated to be MJD
$56496.9\pm0.3$. Substantial time series ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy
obtained from +8 to +135 days are also presented. Considering well-observed SNe
IIP from the literature, we derive $UBVRIJHK$ bolometric calibrations from
$UBVRI$ and unfiltered measurements that potentially reach 2\% precision with a
$B-V$ color-dependent correction. We observe moderately strong Si II
$\lambda6355$ as early as +8 days. The photospheric velocity ($v_{\rm ph}$) is
determined by modeling the spectra in the vicinity of Fe II $\lambda5169$
whenever observed, and interpolating at photometric epochs based on a
semianalytic method. This gives $v_{\rm ph} = 4500\pm500$ km s$^{-1}$ at +50
days. We also observe spectral homogeneity of ultraviolet spectra at +10--12
days for SNe IIP, while variations are evident a week after explosion. Using
the expanding photosphere method, from combined analysis of SN 2013ej and SN
2002ap, we estimate the distance to the host galaxy to be $9.0_{-0.6}^{+0.4}$
Mpc, consistent with distance estimates from other methods. Photometric and
spectroscopic analysis during the plateau phase, which we estimated to be
$94\pm7$ days long, yields an explosion energy of $0.9\pm0.3\times10^{51}$

It is not difficult to imagine that the\nenquiries on external social media and internal call centre may have some\ncoupling relationships. The couplings could be helpful for studying customers'\nintent and allocating government's limited resources for better service. In\nthis paper, we mainly focus on analysing the coupling relations between\ninternal call centre and external public media using time series analysis\nmethods for Australia Department of Immigration and Border Protec-tion. The\ndiscovered couplings demonstrate that call centre and public media indeed have\ncorrelations, which are significant for understanding customers' behaviours.""}","[{'name': 'Fangfang Li'}, {'name': 'Yanchang Zhao'}, {'name': 'Klaus Felsche'}, {'name': 'Guandong Xu'}, {'name': 'Longbing Cao'}]",{'name': 'Longbing Cao'},Longbing Cao,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02238v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02238v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.SI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.SI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,19 pages,

Telescope, APOGEE has collected a half million high resolution (R~22,500), high
S/N (>100), infrared (1.51-1.70 microns) spectra for 146,000 stars, with time
series information via repeat visits to most of these stars. This paper
describes the motivations for the survey and its overall design---hardware,
field placement, target selection, operations---and gives an overview of these
aspects as well as the data reduction, analysis and products. An index is also
given to the complement of technical papers that describe various critical
survey components in detail. Finally, we discuss the achieved survey
performance and illustrate the variety of potential uses of the data products

analysis of stellar spectral variations and radial velocity variations from
stellar companions, to spatial maps of kinematics, metallicity and abundance
patterns across the Galaxy and as a function of age, to new views of the

optimization (PSO) was developed for the time series prediction. The hybrid
ANN+PSO algorithm was applied on Mackey--Glass chaotic time series in the
short-term $x(t+6)$. The performance prediction was evaluated and compared with
another studies available in the literature. Also, we presented properties of
the dynamical system via the study of chaotic behaviour obtained from the
predicted time series. Next, the hybrid ANN+PSO algorithm was complemented with
a Gaussian stochastic procedure (called {\it stochastic} hybrid ANN+PSO) in
order to obtain a new estimator of the predictions, which also allowed us to

fitting to observed data is one major criterion to assess such credibility.
However, more attention has been given to the exploration of model behavior

ranging from late F to mid K and characterize the behaviour of their activity.
We apply the continuous period search (CPS) time series analysis method on 16
to 27 years of photometry to estimate the surface differential rotation and
determine the existence and behaviour of active longitudes and activity cycles
on the stars. We supplement the time series results by calculating new
$\log{R'_{\rm HK}}$ emission indices for the stars from high resolution
spectroscopy. The photometric rotation period variations reveal a positive
correlation between the relative differential rotation coefficient and the
rotation period, but do not reveal any dependence of the differential rotation
on the effective temperature of the stars. Secondary period searches reveal
activity cycles in 18 of the stars and temporary or persistent active
longitudes in 11 of them. The activity cycles fall into specific activity
branches. We find a new split into sub-branches, indicating multiple
simultaneously present cycle modes. Active longitudes appear to be present only
on the more active stars. There is a sharp break at approximately $\log{R'_{\rm
HK}}=-4.46$ separating the less active stars with long-term axisymmetric spot
distributions from the more active ones with non-axisymmetric configurations.
In seven out of eleven of our stars with clearly detected long-term
non-axisymmetric spot activity the estimated active longitude periods are
significantly shorter than the mean photometric rotation periods. This

two directions: By means of a recent result of Reimherr (2015) we show, on one
hand, that the commonly assumed ""separation of the leading eigenvalues"" for
CUSUM procedures can be avoided. This assumption is not a consequence of the

allow to further reduce common assumptions on the eigenstructure under the
alternative. This approach extends directly to multidirectional changes, i.e.
changes that occur at different time points and in different directions, by
fusing sufficient information on them into the first component. The latter
findings are illustrated by a few simulations and compared with existing

atmosphere is well-documented. Applying the technique of solar
magneto-seismology (SMS) allows us to infer the background properties of these
structures. Here, we aim to identify properties of the observed
magneto-acoustic waves and study the background properties of magnetic
structures within the lower solar atmosphere. Using the Dutch Open Telescope
(DOT) and Rapid Oscillations in the Solar Atmosphere (ROSA) instruments, we
captured two series of high-resolution intensity images with short cadence of
two isolated magnetic pores. Combining wavelet analysis and empirical mode
decomposition (EMD), we determined characteristic periods within the
cross-sectional (i.e., area) and intensity time series. Then, by applying the
theory of linear magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we identified the mode of these
oscillations within the MHD framework. Several oscillations have been detected
within these two magnetic pores. Their periods range from 3 to 20 minutes.
Combining wavelet analysis and EMD enables us to confidently find the phase
difference between the area and intensity oscillations. From these observed
features, we concluded that the detected oscillations can be classified as slow
sausage MHD waves. Further, we determined several key properties of these
oscillations such as the radial velocity perturbation, magnetic field
perturbation and vertical wavenumber using solar magnetoseismology. The
estimated range of the related wavenumbers reveals that these oscillations are
trapped within these magnetic structures. Our results suggest that the detected
oscillations are standing harmonics, and, this allows us to estimate the
expansion factor of the waveguides by employing SMS. The calculated expansion
factor ranges from 4-12.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The presence of magneto-acoustic waves in magnetic structures in the solar\natmosphere is well-documented.

Combining wavelet analysis and empirical mode\ndecomposition (EMD), we determined characteristic periods within the\ncross-sectional (i.e., area) and intensity time series. Then, by applying the\ntheory of linear magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), we identified the mode of these\noscillations within the MHD framework. Several oscillations have been detected\nwithin these two magnetic pores. Their periods range from 3 to 20 minutes.\nCombining wavelet analysis and EMD enables us to confidently find the phase\ndifference between the area and intensity oscillations. From these observed\nfeatures, we concluded that the detected oscillations can be classified as slow\nsausage MHD waves. Further, we determined several key properties of these\noscillations such as the radial velocity perturbation, magnetic field\nperturbation and vertical wavenumber using solar magnetoseismology. The\nestimated range of the related wavenumbers reveals that these oscillations are\ntrapped within these magnetic structures. Our results suggest that the detected\noscillations are standing harmonics, and, this allows us to estimate the\nexpansion factor of the waveguides by employing SMS. The calculated expansion\nfactor ranges from 4-12.'}","[{'name': 'N. Freij'}, {'name': 'I. Dorotovic'}, {'name': 'R. J. Morton'}, {'name': 'M. S. Ruderman'}, {'name': 'V. Karlovsky'}, {'name': 'R.

identified 420 flare events from 312 cluster M dwarf stars. For each flare
light curve, we derived observational and physical parameters, such as flare
shape, peak amplitude, duration, energy, and peak luminosity. We show that cool
stars produce serendipitous flares energetic enough to be observed in the
$r$-band, and their temporal and peak characteristics are almost the same as
those in traditional $U$-band observations. We also found many large-amplitude
flares with inferred $\Delta u > 6$ mag in the cluster sample which had been
rarely reported in previous ground-based observations. Following the ergodic
hypothesis, we investigate in detail statistical properties of flare parameters
over a range of energy ($E_{r}$ $\simeq$ $10^{31}-10^{34}$ erg). As expected,
there are no statistical differences in the distributions of flare timescales,
energies, and frequencies among stars of the same age and mass group. We note
that our sample tend to have longer rise and decay timescales compared to those
seen in field flare stars of the same spectral type and be more energetic.
Flare frequency distributions follow power-law distributions with slopes $\beta
\sim0.62-1.21$ for all flare stars and $\beta \sim0.52-0.97$ for stars with

NGC 5408 X-1 is one of the few ultraluminous X-ray sources with an
extensive monitoring program in X-rays (a temporal baseline of 4.2 yr), making
it one of the most suitable candidates to study the long-timescale
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs).
  Aims. Previous timing analysis of the Swift data of NGC 5408 X-1 led to
detection of multiple periodicities ranging from 2.6 d to 230 d. In this paper,
we focus on the statistical significance and the temporal evolution of these
periodicities.
  Methods. A time-series analysis technique in the time-frequency domain, the
weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), was employed to identify the periodicities
and trace their variations with time.
  Results. Three periodic components were detected from the WWZ periodogram,
corresponding to periods of 2.65$\pm$0.01 d, 115.4$\pm$14.4 d and
189.1$\pm$15.2 d. All three have statistical significance higher than 99.74%.
The 2.65-d periodicity is quite stable in the majority of the light curve. The
115-d periodicity is the most prominent but appears variable. The 189-d
periodicity is persistent across the whole time coverage. It shows a steadily
decreasing trend from the beginning (193 d period) to the end (181 d period).
  Conclusions. The long-timescale periodicities in NGC 5408 X-1 are most likely
of super-orbital origin, and are probably associated with the precession of a
warped accretion disc. The disc may have been broken into two distinct planes
with different precessing periods, i.e. the 189-d and 115-d periodicities
corresponding to the outer and inner disc, respectively.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Context.

new distance implies a slightly larger half-light radius of $76^{+12}_{-10}$ pc

object within the realm of the dwarf galaxies. The pulsational properties of

stars and those in the largest of the Milky Way satellites. We also report the

Photometric monitoring of the variability of brown dwarfs can
provide useful information about the structure of clouds in their cold
atmospheres. The brown-dwarf binary system Luhman 16AB is an interesting target
for such a study, as its components stand at the L/T transition and show high
levels of variability. Luhman 16AB is also the third closest system to the
Solar system, allowing precise astrometric investigations with ground-based
facilities. Aims. The aim of the work is to estimate the rotation period and
study the astrometric motion of both components. Methods. We have monitored
Luhman 16AB over a period of two years with the lucky-imaging camera mounted on
the Danish 1.54m telescope at La Silla, through a special i+z long-pass filter,
which allowed us to clearly resolve the two brown dwarfs into single objects.
An intense monitoring of the target was also performed over 16 nights, in which
we observed a peak-to-peak variability of 0.20 \pm 0.02 mag and 0.34 \pm 0.02
mag for Luhman 16A and 16B, respectively. Results. We used the 16-night
time-series data to estimate the rotation period of the two components. We
found that Luhman 16B rotates with a period of 5.1 \pm 0.1 hr, in very good
agreement with previous measurements. For Luhman 16A, we report that it rotates
slower than its companion and, even though we were not able to get a robust
determination, our data indicate a rotation period of roughly 8 hr. This
implies that the rotation axes of the two components are well aligned and
suggests a scenario in which the two objects underwent the same accretion
process. The 2-year complete dataset was used to study the astrometric motion

Kepler binaries. We find good to excellent evidence for a third body in 222
systems via either the light-travel-time (LTTE) or dynamical effect delays.
Approximately half of these systems have been discussed in previous work, while
the rest are newly reported here. Via detailed analysis of the ETV curves using
high-level analytic approximations, we are able to extract system masses and
information about the three-dimensional characteristics of the triple for 62
systems which exhibit both LTTE and dynamical delays; for the remaining 160
systems we give improved LTTE solutions. New techniques of preprocessing the
flux time series are applied to eliminate false positive triples and to enhance

field in connectomics. Entering dynamic functional connectivity by applying
sliding window techniques on resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) time courses emerged
from this topic. We introduce frequency-resolved dynamic functional
connectivity (frdFC) by means of multivariate empirical mode decomposition
(MEMD) followed up by filter-bank investigations. We develop our method on the
most canonical form by applying a sliding window approach to the intrinsic mode
functions (IMFs) resulting from MEMD. We explore two modifications:
uniform-amplitude frequency scales by normalizing the IMFs by their
instantaneous amplitude and cumulative scales. By exploiting the well
established concept of scale-invariance in resting-state parameters, we compare
our frdFC approaches. In general, we find that MEMD is capable of generating
time courses to perform frdFC and we discover that the structure of
connectivity-states is robust over frequency scales and even becomes more
evident with decreasing frequency. This scale-stability varies with the number
of extracted clusters when applying k-means. We find a scale-stability drop-off
from k = 4 to k = 5 extracted connectivity-states, which is corroborated by
null-models, simulations, theoretical considerations, filter-banks, and
scale-adjusted windows. Our filter-bank studies show that filter design is more
delicate in the rs-fMRI than in the simulated case. Besides offering a baseline

The revised model provides data-driven estimates of MMR levels and\ntrends and will be used for MDG 5 reporting for all countries.'}","[{'name': 'Leontine Alkema'}, {'name': 'Sanqian Zhang'}, {'name': 'Doris Chou'}, {'name': 'Alison Gemmill'}, {'name': 'Ann-Beth Moller'}, {'name': 'Doris Ma Fat'}, {'name': 'Lale Say'}, {'name': 'Colin Mathers'}, {'name': 'Daniel Hogan'}]",{'name': 'Daniel Hogan'},Daniel Hogan,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03330v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03330v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'stat.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'stat.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",,,,

recordings of brain activity with high temporal resolution, and thus provide a
unique window to study fast time-scale neural dynamics in humans. However, the
accuracy of brain activity estimates resulting from these data is limited
mainly because 1) the number of sensors is much smaller than the number of
sources, and 2) the low sensitivity of the recording device to deep or radially
oriented sources. These factors limit the number of sources that can be
recovered and bias estimates to superficial cortical areas, resulting in the
need to include a priori information about the source activity. The question of
how to specify this information and how it might lead to improved solutions
remains a critical open problem. In this paper we show that the incorporation
of knowledge about the brain's underlying connectivity and spatiotemporal
dynamics could dramatically improve inverse solutions. To do this, we develop
the concept of the \textit{dynamic lead field mapping}, which expresses how
information about source activity at a given time is mapped not only to the
immediate measurement, but to a time series of measurements. With this mapping
we show that the number of source parameters that can be recovered could
increase by up to a factor of ${\sim20}$, and that such improvement is
primarily represented by deep cortical areas. Our result implies that future
developments in MEG/EEG analysis that model spatialtemporal dynamics have the
potential to dramatically increase source resolution.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""MEG and EEG are noninvasive functional neuroimaging techniques that provide\nrecordings of brain activity with high temporal resolution, and thus provide a\nunique window to study fast time-scale neural dynamics in humans.

The question of\nhow to specify this information and how it might lead to improved solutions\nremains a critical open problem. In this paper we show that the incorporation\nof knowledge about the brain's underlying connectivity and spatiotemporal\ndynamics could dramatically improve inverse solutions. To do this, we develop\nthe concept of the \\textit{dynamic lead field mapping}, which expresses how\ninformation about source activity at a given time is mapped not only to the\nimmediate measurement, but to a time series of measurements. With this mapping\nwe show that the number of source parameters that can be recovered could\nincrease by up to a factor of ${\\sim20}$, and that such improvement is\nprimarily represented by deep cortical areas. Our result implies that future\ndevelopments in MEG/EEG analysis that model spatialtemporal dynamics have the\npotential to dramatically increase source resolution.""}","[{'name': 'Camilo Lamus'}, {'name': 'Matti S.

modeling complex time-varying, nonparametric functions. The Automatic Bayesian
Covariance Discovery (ABCD) system constructs natural-language description of

GP with a composite covariance kernel function. Unfortunately, learning a
composite covariance kernel with a single time-series data set often results in
less informative kernel that may not give qualitative, distinctive descriptions

methods which can model multiple time-series data sets by finding common,

complexity in the analysis of time series data, especially in physiology and
medicine. Entropy measures the rate of information gain, or degree of
regularity in a time series e.g. heartbeat. Ideally, entropy should be able to
quantify the complexity of any underlying structure in the series, as well as
determine if the variation arises from a random process. Unfortunately current
entropy measures mostly are unable to perform the latter differentiation. Thus,
a high entropy score indicates a random or chaotic series, whereas a low score
indicates a high degree of regularity. This leads to the observation that
current entropy measures are equivalent to evaluating how random a series is,
or conversely the degree of regularity in a time series. This raises the
possibility that existing tests for randomness, such as the runs test or
permutation test, may have similar utility in diagnosing certain conditions.
This paper compares various tests for randomness with existing entropy-based
measurements such as sample entropy, permutation entropy and multi-scale
entropy. Our experimental results indicate that the test statistics of the runs
test and permutation test are often highly correlated with entropy scores and

Entropy measures the rate of information gain, or degree of\nregularity in a time series e.g. heartbeat. Ideally, entropy should be able to\nquantify the complexity of any underlying structure in the series, as well as\ndetermine if the variation arises from a random process. Unfortunately current\nentropy measures mostly are unable to perform the latter differentiation. Thus,\na high entropy score indicates a random or chaotic series, whereas a low score\nindicates a high degree of regularity. This leads to the observation that\ncurrent entropy measures are equivalent to evaluating how random a series is,\nor conversely the degree of regularity in a time series. This raises the\npossibility that existing tests for randomness, such as the runs test or\npermutation test, may have similar utility in diagnosing certain conditions.\nThis paper compares various tests for randomness with existing entropy-based\nmeasurements such as sample entropy, permutation entropy and multi-scale\nentropy.

to disseminate their services, contents and data over multiple cloud
data-centers often involving several Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). The
consequence of this is that a large amount of bytes must be transmitted across
the public Cloud. However, very little is known about its bandwidth dynamics.
To address this, we have conducted a measurement campaign for bandwidth between
eighteen data-centers of four major CSPs. Such extensive campaign allowed us to
characterize the resulting time series of bandwidth as the addition of a
stationary component and some infrequent excursions (typically, downtimes).
While the former provides a description of the bandwidth users can expect in
the Cloud, the latter is closely related to the robustness of the Cloud (i.e.,
the occurrence of downtimes is correlated). Both components have been studied
further by applying a factor analysis, specifically ANOVA, as a mechanism to
formally compare data-centers' behaviors and extract generalities. The results
show that the stationary process is closely related to data-center locations
and CSPs involved in transfers, which fortunately makes both the Cloud more
predictable and the set of reported measurements extrapolate. On the other
hand, although the correlation in the Cloud is low, i.e., only 10% of the
measured pair of paths showed some correlation, we have found evidence that
such correlation depends on the particular relationships between pairs of
data-centers with little link to more general factors. Positively, this implies
that data-centers either at the same area or CSP do not show qualitatively more
correlation than others data-centers, which eases the deployment of robust
infrastructures. On the downside, this metric is barely generalizable and,
consequently, calls for exhaustive monitoring.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""The seek for the best quality of service has led Cloud infrastructure clients\nto disseminate their services, contents and data over multiple cloud\ndata-centers often involving several Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

The results\nshow that the stationary process is closely related to data-center locations\nand CSPs involved in transfers, which fortunately makes both the Cloud more\npredictable and the set of reported measurements extrapolate. On the other\nhand, although the correlation in the Cloud is low, i.e., only 10% of the\nmeasured pair of paths showed some correlation, we have found evidence that\nsuch correlation depends on the particular relationships between pairs of\ndata-centers with little link to more general factors. Positively, this implies\nthat data-centers either at the same area or CSP do not show qualitatively more\ncorrelation than others data-centers, which eases the deployment of robust\ninfrastructures. On the downside, this metric is barely generalizable and,\nconsequently, calls for exhaustive monitoring.""}",[{'name': 'Jose Luis Garcia-Dorado'}],{'name': 'Jose Luis Garcia-Dorado'},Jose Luis Garcia-Dorado,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3093893', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01129v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.01129v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'cs.NI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.NI', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.DC', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",10.1145/3093893,"Bandwidth Measurements within the Cloud: Characterizing Regular

they are associated with sub-parsec supermassive black hole (SMBH) binaries.
Here, we test the binary broad-line region hypothesis through several decades
of monitoring of the velocity structure of double-peaked H-alpha emission lines
in 13 low-redshift, mostly radio-loud AGNs. This is a much larger set of
objects compared to an earlier test by Eracleous et al. (1997) and we use much
longer time series for the three objects studied in that paper. Although
systematic changes in radial velocity can be traced in many of their lines,
they are demonstrably not like those of a spectroscopic binary in a circular
orbit. Any spectroscopic binary period must therefore be much longer than the
span of the monitoring (assuming a circular orbit), which in turn would require
black hole masses that exceed by 1-2 orders of magnitude the values obtained
for these objects using techniques such as reverberation mapping and stellar
velocity dispersion. Moreover, the response of the double-peaked Balmer line
profiles to fluctuations of the ionizing continuum and the shape of the
Ly-alpha profiles are incompatible with a SMBH binary. The binary broad-line
region hypothesis is therefore disfavored. Other processes evidently shape
these line profiles and cause the long-term velocity variations of the double

Gaussian noise (fGn), and differentiated fGn (DfGn) is described by the Hurst
exponent $H$. Considering the realisations of these three processes as time
series, they might be described by their statistical features, such as half of
the ratio of the mean square successive difference to the variance,
$\mathcal{A}$, and the number of turning points, $T$. This paper investigates
the relationships between $\mathcal{A}$ and $H$, and between $T$ and $H$. It is
found numerically that the formulae $\mathcal{A}(H)=a{\rm e}^{bH}$ in case of
fBm, and $\mathcal{A}(H)=a+bH^c$ for fGn and DfGn, describe well the
$\mathcal{A}(H)$ relationship. When $T(H)$ is considered, no simple formula is
found, and it is empirically found that among polynomials, the fourth and
second order description applies best. The most relevant finding is that when
plotted in the space of $(\mathcal{A},T)$, the three process types form
separate branches. Hence, it is examined whether $\mathcal{A}$ and $T$ may
serve as Hurst exponent indicators. Some real world data (stock market indices,
sunspot numbers, chaotic time series) are analyzed for this purpose, and it is
found that the $H$'s estimated using the $H(\mathcal{A})$ relations (expressed
as inverted $\mathcal{A}(H)$ functions) are consistent with the $H$'s extracted
with the well known wavelet approach. This allows to efficiently estimate the
Hurst exponent based on fast and easy to compute $\mathcal{A}$ and $T$, given
that the process type: fBm, fGn or DfGn, is correctly classified beforehand.

This paper investigates\nthe relationships between $\\mathcal{A}$ and $H$, and between $T$ and $H$. It is\nfound numerically that the formulae $\\mathcal{A}(H)=a{\\rm e}^{bH}$ in case of\nfBm, and $\\mathcal{A}(H)=a+bH^c$ for fGn and DfGn, describe well the\n$\\mathcal{A}(H)$ relationship. When $T(H)$ is considered, no simple formula is\nfound, and it is empirically found that among polynomials, the fourth and\nsecond order description applies best. The most relevant finding is that when\nplotted in the space of $(\\mathcal{A},T)$, the three process types form\nseparate branches. Hence, it is examined whether $\\mathcal{A}$ and $T$ may\nserve as Hurst exponent indicators. Some real world data (stock market indices,\nsunspot numbers, chaotic time series) are analyzed for this purpose, and it is\nfound that the $H$'s estimated using the $H(\\mathcal{A})$ relations (expressed\nas inverted $\\mathcal{A}(H)$ functions) are consistent with the $H$'s extracted\nwith the well known wavelet approach. This allows to efficiently estimate the\nHurst exponent based on fast and easy to compute $\\mathcal{A}$ and $T$, given\nthat the process type: fBm, fGn or DfGn, is correctly classified beforehand.\nFinally, it is suggested that the $\\mathcal{A}(H)$ relation for fGn and DfGn\nmight be an exact (shifted) $3/2$ power-law.""}",[{'name': 'Mariusz Tarnopolski'}],{'name': 'Mariusz Tarnopolski'},Mariusz Tarnopolski,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.physa.2016.06.004', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02928v4', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02928v4', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","{'term': 'physics.data-an', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'physics.data-an', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'math.DS', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'nlin.AO', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",10.1016/j.physa.2016.06.004,"Physica A, 461, 662-673, 2016","20 pages in one-column format, 7 figures; matches the version

reflection of internal cognitive processes is a hallmark of human brain
function. However, its identification in fMRI data of the human brain is
notoriously difficult. Here we propose a new method of fMRI data analysis that
tackles this problem by considering large-scale, task-related synchronisation
networks. Networks consist of nodes and edges connecting them, where nodes
correspond to voxels in fMRI data, and the weight of an edge is determined via
task-related changes in dynamic synchronisation between their respective times
series. Based on these definitions, we developed a new data analysis algorithm
that identifies edges in a brain network that differentially respond in unison
to a task onset and that occur in dense packs with similar characteristics.
Hence, we call this approach ""Task-related Edge Density"" (TED). TED proved to
be a very strong marker for dynamic network formation that easily lends itself
to statistical analysis using large scale statistical inference. A major
advantage of TED compared to other methods is that it does not depend on any
specific hemodynamic response model, and it also does not require a
presegmentation of the data for dimensionality reduction as it can handle large
networks consisting of tens of thousands of voxels. We applied TED to fMRI data
of a fingertapping task provided by the Human Connectome Project. TED revealed
network-based involvement of a large number of brain areas that evaded
detection using traditional GLM-based analysis. We show that our proposed
method provides an entirely new window into the immense complexity of human
brain function.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The formation of transient networks in response to external stimuli or as a\nreflection of internal cognitive processes is a hallmark of human brain\nfunction.

Health economic evaluations of interventions against infectious
diseases are commonly based on the predictions of ordinary differential
equation (ODE) systems or Markov models (MMs). Standard MMs are static, whereas
ODE systems are usually dynamic and account for herd immunity which is crucial
to prevent overestimation of infection prevalence. Complex ODE systems
including probabilistic model parameters are computationally intensive. Thus,
mainly ODE-based models including deterministic parameters are presented in the
literature. These do not account for parameter uncertainty. As a consequence,
probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA), a crucial component of health
economic evaluations, cannot be conducted straightforwardly.
  Methods. We present a dynamic MM under a Bayesian framework. We extend a
static MM by incorporating the force of infection into the state allocation
algorithm. The corresponding output is based on dynamic changes in prevalence
and thus accounts for herd immunity. In contrast to deterministic ODE-based
models, PSA can be conducted straightforwardly. We introduce a case study of a
fictional sexually transmitted infection and compare our dynamic Bayesian MM to
a deterministic and a Bayesian ODE system. The models are calibrated to time
series data.
  Results. By means of the case study, we show that our methodology produces
outcome which is comparable to the ""gold standard"" of the Bayesian ODE system.
  Conclusions. In contrast to ODE systems in the literature, the setting of the
dynamic MM is probabilistic at manageable computational effort (including
calibration).

extremes warm more than mean shifts in wintertime temperatures, but changes in
GEV location parameters are largely explainable by mean shifts combined with
reduced wintertime temperature variability. In addition, changes in the spread

lead to discernible changes in tail behavior. We then examine uncertainties

the Orion Nebula Cluster with a circumbinary disc accreting on the lower-mass
component. The analysis is based on high-resolution spectroscopic data and
high-quality photometric time series about 20-yr long. Thanks to the
spectroscopy, we confirm the binary nature of this system consisting of M3 + M4
components and derive the mass ratio M_B/M_A = 0.54, a variable luminosity
ratio L_B/L_A = 0.68--0.94, and an orbital period P_orb = 4.433d. The
photometric data allowed us to measure the rotation periods of the two
components P_phot = 4.4351d and they are found to be synchronized with the
orbital period. The simultaneous modeling of V-, I-band, and radial velocity
curves in the 2005 season suggests that the variability is dominated by one hot
spot on the secondary component covering at least about 3.5% of the stellar
surface and about 420K hotter than the unperturbed photosphere. Such a spot may
originate from the material of the circumbinary disc accreting onto the
secondary component. We also detect an apparent 6-yr periodic variation in the
position of this hot spot, which is inferred from the phase migration of the
light curve maximum, which we interpret as due to either the presence of
surface differential rotation as large as 0.065%, a value compatible with the
fully convective components, or to a periodic exchange of angular momentum
between the disc and the star, which implies a minimum magnetic field strength
of 650G at the stellar surface.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We present the results of our analysis on V1481 Ori (JW 239), a young SB2 in\nthe Orion Nebula Cluster with a circumbinary disc accreting on the lower-mass\ncomponent.

high activity that are followed by rest periods. Records of this process
generate time series of events whose inter-event times follow a probability
distribution that displays a fat tail. The grounds for such phenomenon are not
yet clearly understood. In the present work we use the freely available
Wikipedia's editing records to tackle this question by measuring the level of
burstiness, as well as the memory effect of the editing tasks performed by
different editors in different pages. Our main finding is that, even though the
editing activity is conditioned by the circadian 24 hour cycle, the conditional
probability of an activity of a given duration at a given time of the day is

increase of data to monitor. Classical techniques for time series
classification rely on point-to-point distances. Recently, Bag-of-Words
approaches have been used in this context. Words are quantized versions of
simple features extracted from sliding windows. The SIFT framework has proved
efficient for image classification. In this paper, we design a time series
classification scheme that builds on the SIFT framework adapted to time series
to feed a Bag-of-Words. We then refine our method by studying the impact of

correct time series without not-anomalous data, the extremes time series are

considered lagged among them. We think that climate events frequently are
lagged because the climate show a clear increasing tendency, and that climate
risks are potentially increasing during the time. There will be no specific

autoregression can be adapted to any time series analysis.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'In this article there is no intention to repeat basic concepts about risk\nmanagement, but we will try to define why often is usefull the time series\nanalysis during the assessment of risks, and how is possible to compute a\nsignificative analysis using regression and autoregression.

the breakdown of linear response given observations of deterministic dynamical
systems. A goodness-of-fit statistics is developed for a linear statistical
model of the observations, based on results on central limit theorems for
deterministic dynamical systems, and used to detect linear response breakdown.
We apply the method to discrete maps which do not obey linear response and show
that the successful detection of breakdown depends on the length of the time
series, the magnitude of the perturbation and on the choice of the observable.
  We find that in order to reliably reject the assumption of linear response
for typical observables sufficiently large data sets are needed. Even for
simple systems such as the logistic map, one needs of the order of $10^6$
observations to reliably detect the breakdown, if less observations are
available one may be falsely led to conclude that linear response theory is
valid. The amount of data required is larger the smaller the applied
perturbation. For judiciously chosen observables the necessary amount of data
can be drastically reduced, but requires detailed {\em{a priori}} knowledge
about the invariant measure which is typically not available for complex
dynamical systems.
  Furthermore we explore the use of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT)
in cases with limited data length or coarse-graining of observations. The FDT,
if applied naively to a system without linear response, is shown to be very
sensitive to the details of the sampling method, resulting in erroneous
predictions of the response.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=4000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Using a sensitive statistical test we determine whether or not one can detect\nthe breakdown of linear response given observations of deterministic dynamical\nsystems.
