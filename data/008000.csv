statistics of reorientations of large-scale circulation (LSC) in turbulent
rotating Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection (RRBC) for air ($Pr=0.7$) contained in
a cylindrical cell with unit aspect ratio. A wide range of rotation rates
($0\leq Ro^{-1}\leq 30$) is considered for two different Rayleigh numbers
$Ra=2\times10^6$ and $2\times10^7$. Using the Fourier mode analysis of time
series data obtained from the different probes placed in the azimuthal
direction of the container at the mid-plane, the orientation and associated
dynamics of LSC are characterized. The amplitude of the first Fourier mode
quantifies the strength of LSC and its phase $\Phi_1$ gives the information of
the azimuthal orientation of LSC. Based on the energy contained in the Fourier
modes different flow regimes are identified as the rotation rate is varied for
a given Rayleigh number. LSC structure is observed in the low rotation regime (
$Ro^{-1} \lesssim 1$). A strong correlation between the orientation of LSC
structure and the heat transfer and boundary layer dynamics is observed. In the
LSC regime, the dissipation rates follow the log-normal behaviour, while at
higher rotation rates, a clear departure from log-normality is noticed.
Different types of reorientations, namely, rotation-led, cessation-led, partial
and complete reversal are identified. The distribution of change in orientation
of LSC follows a power law behaviour as $P(|\Delta \Phi_1|) \propto |\Delta
\Phi_1|^{-m}$, with the exponent $m\approx 3.7$. In addition, the statistics of

Three binary cross-entropy loss\nfunctions corresponding to sleep/wake, target arousal and apnea-hypopnea/normal\ndetection tasks are summed up to generate our overall network loss function\nthat is optimized using the Adam method. Our model performance was evaluated\nusing two metrics: the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and the\narea under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). To measure our\nmodel generalization, 4-fold cross-validation was also performed. For training,\nour model was applied to full night recording data. Finally, the average AUPRC\nand AUROC values associated with the arousal detection task were 0.505 and\n0.922, respectively on our testing dataset. An ensemble of four models trained\non different data folds improved the AUPRC and AUROC to 0.543 and 0.931,\nrespectively. Our proposed algorithm achieved the first place in the official\nstage of the 2018 Physionet challenge for detecting sleep arousals with AUPRC\nof 0.54 on the blind testing dataset.'}","[{'name': 'Bahareh Pourbabaee'}, {'name': 'Matthew Howe-Patterson'}, {'name': 'Matthew Patterson'}, {'name': 'Frederic Benard'}]",{'name': 'Frederic Benard'},Frederic Benard,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04377v2', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.04377v2', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","20 pages, 4 figures, Accepted to be published by Physiological

to spectral condensation of energy when the layer height is smaller than a
certain threshold. These spectral condensates take the form of large-scale

this system close to the critical height: depending on the initial conditions,
the flow is either in a condensate state with most of the energy in the
two-dimensional (2-D) large-scale modes, or in a three-dimensional (3-D) flow

characterised by the statistical properties of random and rare transitions

properties in thin-layer turbulent flows, where the energy is injected by
either stochastic or deterministic forcing. To this end, by using a large
number of direct numerical simulations (DNS), we measure the decay time

While training remains\ntractable for moderately sized networks, Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\napproximations of gradients are derived for deep networks which contain latent\nvariables. The statistical framework is evaluated on synthetic data,\nhigh-dimensional binary data of handwritten digits, and web-crawled natural\nlanguage data.

using diverse and robust statistical tools. Power-law distributions, for
example, project diverse natural phenomenon, ranging from earthquakes1 to
heartbeat dynamics2 onto a common platform of statistical self-similarity. A
large range of human languages are known to follow a specific regime of
power-law distributions, the Zipf-Mandelbrot law, in addition to showing
properties like the Pareto principle and Shannon entropy3,4. Animal behaviour
in specific contexts have been shown to follow power-law distributions5,6.
However, the entire behavioural repertoire of a species has never been analysed
for the existence of underlying patterns. Here we show that the frequency-rank
data of randomly sighted behaviours at the population level of free-ranging
dogs follow a scale-invariant power-law behaviour. While the data does not
display Zipfian trends, it obeys the Pareto principle and Shannon entropy rules
akin to languages. Interestingly, the data also exhibits robust self-similarity
patterns at different scales which we extract using multifractal detrended
fluctuation analysis7. The observed multifractal trends suggest that the
probability of consecutive occurrence of behaviours of adjacent ranks is much
higher than behaviours widely separated in rank. Since we observe such robust
trends in random data sets, we hypothesize that the general behavioural
repertoire of a species is shaped by a syntax similar to languages. This opens
up the prospect of future multifractal and other statistical investigations on
true time series of behavioural data to probe the existence of possible long

It differs from most other methods in the field of\nmultiresolution analysis (MRA) in that it 1) accounts for spatial and temporal\ncoherencies simultaneously, making it more robust to scale overlap between\ncomponents, and 2) yields a closed-form expression for local dynamics at each\nscale, which can be used for short-term prediction of any or all components.\nOur technique is an extension of multi-resolution dynamic mode decomposition\n(mrDMD), generalized to treat a broader variety of multiscale systems and more\nfaithfully reconstruct their isolated components. In this paper we present an\noverview of our algorithm and its results on two example physical systems, and\nbriefly discuss some advantages and potential forecasting applications for the\ntechnique.'}","[{'name': 'Daniel Dylewsky'}, {'name': 'Molei Tao'}, {'name': 'J.

Visual detection is time-consuming and biased by the observer interpretation

Their actual planetary population is however not yet precisely understood.
Currently several surveys aim to expand the statistics with intensive detection
campaigns, both photometric and spectroscopic. We analyse 106 spectroscopic
HARPS-N observations of the active M0-type star GJ 685 taken over the past five
years. We combine these data with photometric measurements from different
observatories to accurately model the stellar rotation and disentangle its
signals from genuine Doppler planetary signals in the RV data. We run an MCMC
analysis on the RV and activity indexes time series to model the planetary and
stellar signals present in the data, applying Gaussian Process regression
technique to deal with the stellar activity signals. We identify three periodic
signals in the RV time series, with periods of 9, 24, and 18 d. Combining the
analyses of the photometry of the star with the activity indexes derived from
the HARPS-N spectra, we identify the 18 d and 9 d signals as activity-related,
corresponding to the stellar rotation period and its first harmonic
respectively. The 24 d signals shows no relations with any activity proxy, so
we identify it as a genuine planetary signal. We find the best-fit model
describing the Doppler signal of the newly-found planet, GJ 685\,b,
corresponding to an orbital period $P_b = 24.160^{+0.061}_{-0.047}$ d and a
minimum mass $M_P \sin i = 9.0^{+1.7}_{-1.8}$ M$_\oplus$. We also study a
sample of 70 RV-detected M-dwarf planets, and present new statistical evidence

train a model of Mr. Boddy's dynamics on the time series of observed murders,

location, and murderer. We find that a successful estimation requires three
additional elements. First, to minimize the effects of selection bias, generous

the Poisoned Apple, and the Wife. Second, motive, which was not considered
relevant to previous murders, is added as a parameter. Third, Mr. Boddy's

17:19:03 EDT this afternoon, with a standard deviation of seven hours, at The

prediction tasks. However, training deep networks such as those based on
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) requires large labeled data, significant
hyper-parameter tuning effort and expertise, and high computational resources.
In this work, we investigate as to what extent can transfer learning address
these issues when using deep RNNs to model multivariate clinical time series.
We consider two scenarios for transfer learning using RNNs: i)
domain-adaptation, i.e., leveraging a deep RNN - namely, TimeNet - pre-trained
for feature extraction on time series from diverse domains, and adapting it for
feature extraction and subsequent target tasks in healthcare domain, ii)
task-adaptation, i.e., pre-training a deep RNN - namely, HealthNet - on diverse
tasks in healthcare domain, and adapting it to new target tasks in the same
domain. We evaluate the above approaches on publicly available MIMIC-III
benchmark dataset, and demonstrate that (a) computationally-efficient linear
models trained using features extracted via pre-trained RNNs outperform or, in
the worst case, perform as well as deep RNNs and statistical hand-crafted
features based models trained specifically for target task; (b) models obtained
by adapting pre-trained models for target tasks are significantly more robust
to the size of labeled data compared to task-specific RNNs, while also being
computationally efficient. We, therefore, conclude that pre-trained deep models
like TimeNet and HealthNet allow leveraging the advantages of deep learning for
clinical time series analysis tasks, while also minimize dependence on
hand-crafted features, deal robustly with scarce labeled training data
scenarios without overfitting, as well as reduce dependence on expertise and
resources required to train deep networks from scratch.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=8000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Deep neural networks have shown promising results for various clinical\nprediction tasks.

automatically recorded and accumulated for process monitoring and defect
diagnosis. As casting is a thermal process with many interacting process
parameters, root cause analysis tends to be tedious and ineffective. We show
how a decomposition based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), which is
guided by a knowledge-based initialization strategy, is able to extract
physical meaningful sources from temperature time series collected during a
thermal manufacturing process. The approach assumes the time series to be
generated by a superposition of several simultaneously acting component
processes. NMF is able to reverse the superposition and to identify the hidden
component processes. The latter can be linked to ongoing physical phenomena and
process variables, which cannot be monitored directly. Our approach provides
new insights into the underlying physics and offers a tool, which can assist in

spectral density includes radiative corrections in leading, next-to-leading,
and next-to-next-to-leading-order of perturbative QCD. Besides, it takes into

LCSR is convoluted with various pion distribution amplitudes with different
morphologies in order to obtain a wide range of predictions for the form
factor, including two-loop evolution which accounts for heavy-quark thresholds.
We then use nonlinear time series analysis to extract information on the
long-term $Q^2$ behavior of the measured scaled form factor in terms of
state-space attractors embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$. These are reconstructed by
applying the Packard-Takens method of delays to appropriate samplings of the
data obtained in the CLEO, \textit{BABAR}, and Belle single-tagged $e^+e^- \to

prediction of arrival time of buses is still a challenging problem in
dynamically varying traffic conditions especially under heterogeneous traffic
condition without lane discipline. One broad approach researchers have adopted
over the years is to segment the entire bus route into segments and work with
these segment travel times as the data input (from GPS traces) for prediction.
This paper adopts this approach and proposes predictive modelling approaches
which fully exploit the temporal correlations in the bus GPS data.
Specifically, we propose two approaches: (a) classical time-series approach
employing a seasonal AR model (b)unconventional linear, non-stationary AR
approach. The second approach is a novel technique and exploits the notion of
partial correlation for learning from data. A detailed analysis of the marginal
distributions of the data from Indian conditions (used here), revealed a
predominantly log-normal behavior. This aspect was incorporated into the above
proposed predictive models and statistically optimal prediction schemes in the
lognormal sense are utilized for all predictions. Both the above temporal
predictive modeling approaches predict ahead in time at each segment
independently. For real-time bus travel time prediction, one however needs to
predict across multiple segments ahead in space. Towards a complete solution,
the study also proposes an intelligent procedure to perform (real-time)
multi-section ahead travel-time predictions based on either of the above
proposed temporal models. Results showed a clear improvement in prediction

epileptic seizure prediction system using intracranial EEG (iEEG) data,
especially for people with drug-resistant epilepsy. The prediction procedure

impending seizures. Methods: We quantitatively analyze the human iEEG data to
obtain insights into how the human brain behaves before and between epileptic
seizures. We then introduce an efficient pre-processing method for reducing the
data size and converting the time-series iEEG data into an image-like format
that can be used as inputs to convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Further, we
propose a seizure prediction algorithm that uses cooperative multi-scale CNNs

complementary information and excluding individual channels is not advisable to
retain the spatial information needed for accurate prediction of epileptic

the magnetic activity and rotational evolution of the Sun. Space-borne
photometry by the Kepler telescope provides unprecedented datasets to
investigate these phenomena in Sun-like stars. We present a new analysis of the
entire Kepler photometric time series of the moderately young Sun-like star
Kepler-17 that is accompanied by a transiting hot Jupiter. We applied a
maximum-entropy spot model to the long-cadence out-of-transit photometry of the
target to derive maps of the starspot filling factor versus the longitude and
the time. These maps are compared to the spots occulted during transits to
validate our reconstruction and derive information on the latitudes of the
starspots. We find two main active longitudes on the photosphere of Kepler-17,
one of which has a lifetime of at least $\sim 1400$ days, although with a
varying level of activity. The latitudinal differential rotation is of solar
type, that is, with the equator rotating faster than the poles. We estimate a
minimum relative amplitude $\Delta \Omega/ \Omega$ between $\sim 0.08 \pm 0.05$

individual starspots and depending on the adopted spot model parameters. We
find marginal evidence of a short-term intermittent activity cycle of $\sim 48$
days and an indication of a longer cycle of $400-600$ days characterized by an
equatorward migration of the mean latitude of the spots as in the Sun. The
rotation of Kepler-17 is likely to be significantly affected by the tides
raised by its massive close-by planet. We confirm the reliability of

the first approach the time series is embedded into a point cloud which is then

path between the graph's nodes, and this matrix is utilized to define a
filtration of a simplicial complex that enables tracking the changes in
homology classes over the course of the filtration. These changes are
summarized in a persistence diagram---a two-dimensional summary of changes in
the topological features. We then extract existing as well as new geometric and

field and a short rotation period ($P_{\rm rot} \sim 1$ d). While it is clearly
a rapid rotator, recent determinations of $P_{\rm rot}$ are in formal
disagreement. In this paper we collect magnetic and photometric data with a
combined 40-year baseline in order to re-evaluate $P_{\rm rot}$ and examine its
stability. Both period analysis of individual datasets and $O-C$ analysis of
the photometric data demonstrate that $P_{\rm rot}$ has decreased over the past
30 years, violating expectations from magnetospheric braking models, but
consistent with behaviour reported for 2 other hot, rapidly rotating magnetic
stars, CU Vir and HD 37776. The available magnetic and photometric time series
for HD 142990 can be coherently phased assuming a spin-up rate $\dot{P}$ of

fleet consisting of 264 gasoline vehicles, 92 HEVs, and 27 PHEV/EVs drove in
real-world from Nov, 2017 to Nov, 2018, where the data were collected through
onboard OBD-II loggers. Driving scenarios range from highways to traffic-dense
downtown area in various driving conditions and seasons. In total, VED
accumulates approximately 374,000 miles. We discuss participant privacy
protection and develop a method to de-identify personally identifiable
information while preserving the quality of the data. After the
de-identification, we conducted case studies on the dataset to investigate the
impacts of factors known to affect fuel economy and identify energy-saving
opportunities that hybrid-electric vehicles and eco-driving techniques can

acceleration of the power method (PM). The power method is a simple technique
for determining the dominant eigenmode of an operator $\mathbf{A}$, and
variants of the power method are widely used in reactor analysis. Dynamic mode
decomposition is an algorithm for decomposing a time-series of
spatially-dependent data and producing an explicit-in-time reconstruction for
that data. By viewing successive power-method iterates as snapshots of a
time-varying system tending toward a steady state, DMD can be used to predict
that steady state using (a sometime surprisingly small) $n$ iterates. The
process of generating snapshots with the power method and extrapolating forward
with DMD can be repeated. The resulting restarted, DMD-accelerated power method
(or DMD-PM($n$)) was applied to the two-dimensional IAEA diffusion benchmark
and compared to the unaccelerated power method and Arnoldi's method. Results
indicate that DMD-PM($n$) can reduce the number of power iterations required by
approximately a factor of 5. However, Arnoldi's method always outperformed
DMD-PM($n$) for an equivalent number of matrix-vector products $\mathbf{Av}$.
In other words, DMD-PM($n$) cannot compete with leading eigensolvers if one is
not limited to snapshots produced by the power method. Contrarily, DMD-PM($n$)
can be readily applied as a post process to existing power-method applications
for which Arnoldi and similar methods are not directly applicable. A slight
variation of the method was also found to produce reasonable approximations to

The power method is a simple technique\nfor determining the dominant eigenmode of an operator $\\mathbf{A}$, and\nvariants of the power method are widely used in reactor analysis. Dynamic mode\ndecomposition is an algorithm for decomposing a time-series of\nspatially-dependent data and producing an explicit-in-time reconstruction for\nthat data. By viewing successive power-method iterates as snapshots of a\ntime-varying system tending toward a steady state, DMD can be used to predict\nthat steady state using (a sometime surprisingly small) $n$ iterates. The\nprocess of generating snapshots with the power method and extrapolating forward\nwith DMD can be repeated. The resulting restarted, DMD-accelerated power method\n(or DMD-PM($n$)) was applied to the two-dimensional IAEA diffusion benchmark\nand compared to the unaccelerated power method and Arnoldi's method. Results\nindicate that DMD-PM($n$) can reduce the number of power iterations required by\napproximately a factor of 5. However, Arnoldi's method always outperformed\nDMD-PM($n$) for an equivalent number of matrix-vector products $\\mathbf{Av}$.\nIn other words, DMD-PM($n$) cannot compete with leading eigensolvers if one is\nnot limited to snapshots produced by the power method. Contrarily, DMD-PM($n$)\ncan be readily applied as a post process to existing power-method applications\nfor which Arnoldi and similar methods are not directly applicable. A slight\nvariation of the method was also found to produce reasonable approximations to\nthe first and second harmonics without substantially affecting convergence of\nthe dominant mode.""}","[{'name': 'Jeremy A.

North-South asymmetry in the maxima and minima of the Solar Cycles 12-24. We

low-accretion states in 2016, 2017, and 2018, and using newly available
photographic plates, we identify pre-discovery low states in 1965, 1966, and
1974. The primary focus of our analysis, however, is an extensive set of
time-series photometry obtained between 2002 and 2018, with particularly
intensive coverage of the 2016-2018 low states. After computing an updated spin
ephemeris for the white dwarf (WD), we show that its spin period began to
increase in 2014 after having spent 27 years decreasing; no other intermediate
polar has experienced a sign change of its period derivative, but FO Aqr has
now done so twice. Our central finding is that the recent low states all
occurred shortly after the WD began to spin down, even though no low states
were reported in the preceding quarter-century, when it was spinning up.
Additionally, the system's mode of accretion is extremely sensitive to the
mass-transfer rate, with accretion being almost exclusively disk-fed when FO
Aqr is brighter than V~14 and substantially stream-fed when it is not. Even in
the low states, a grazing eclipse remains detectable, confirming the presence
of a disk-like structure (but not necessarily a Keplerian accretion disk). We
relate these various observations to theoretical predictions that during the
low state, the system's accretion disk dissipates into a non-Keplerian ring of

Even in\nthe low states, a grazing eclipse remains detectable, confirming the presence\nof a disk-like structure (but not necessarily a Keplerian accretion disk).

at once in a single visit, and others that are dispersed over multiple visits,

we propose models for analyzing sequences of multivariate clinical time series

and significant computational resources. In this paper, we propose ConvTimeNet
(CTN): an off-the-shelf deep convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on
diverse univariate time series classification (TSC) source tasks. Once trained,
CTN can be easily adapted to new TSC target tasks via a small amount of
fine-tuning using labeled instances from the target tasks. We note that the
length of convolutional filters is a key aspect when building a pre-trained
model that can generalize to time series of different lengths across datasets.
To achieve this, we incorporate filters of multiple lengths in all
convolutional layers of CTN to capture temporal features at multiple time
scales. We consider all 65 datasets with time series of lengths up to 512
points from the UCR TSC Benchmark for training and testing transferability of
CTN: We train CTN on a randomly chosen subset of 24 datasets using a multi-head

These examples show that the bHP filter is helpful in\nanalyzing a large collection of heterogeneous macroeconomic time series that\nmanifest various degrees of persistence, trend behavior, and volatility.'}","[{'name': 'Peter C.

processing complex sequential information since it utilizes special gating
schemes for learning representations from long input sequences. It has the
potential to model any sequential time-series data, where the current hidden
state has to be considered in the context of the past hidden states. This
property makes LSTM an ideal choice to learn the complex dynamics present in
long sequences. Unfortunately, the conventional LSTMs do not consider the
impact of spatio-temporal dynamics corresponding to the given salient motion
patterns, when they gate the information that ought to be memorized through
time. To address this problem, we propose a differential gating scheme for the
LSTM neural network, which emphasizes on the change in information gain caused
by the salient motions between the successive video frames. This change in
information gain is quantified by Derivative of States (DoS), and thus the
proposed LSTM model is termed as differential Recurrent Neural Network (dRNN).

of exoplanets. With the advent of TESS and, in the future, of PLATO, more and
more transiting planets around bright stars will be found and the observing
time at large telescopes currently used to apply these techniques will not
suffice. We demonstrate here that 2-m class telescopes equipped with
spectrographs with high resolving power may be used for a certain number of
potential targets. We obtained a time series of high-resolution FEROS spectra
at the 2.2-m telescope at La Silla of the very hot Jupiter hosting planet
WASP-18b and show that our upper limit is consistent with the expectations.
This is the first analysis of its kind using 2-m class telescopes, and serves
to highlight their potential. In this context, we then proceed to discuss the
suitability of this class of telescopes for the upcoming flood of
scientifically interesting targets from TESS space mission, and propose a

biosignal generative models based on generative adversarial networks (GANs),
which are a type of deep learning technique, was demonstrated in our previous
paper. GAN-based generative models only learn the projection between a random
distribution as input data and the distribution of training data.Therefore, the
relationship between input and generated data is unclear, and the
characteristics of the data generated from this model cannot be controlled.
This study proposes a method for generating time-series data based on GANs and
explores their ability to generate biosignals with certain classes and
characteristics. Moreover, in the proposed method, latent variables are
analyzed using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to represent the
relationship between input and generated data as canonical loadings. Using
these loadings, we can control the characteristics of the data generated by the
proposed method. The influence of class labels on generated data is analyzed by
feeding the data interpolated between two class labels into the generator of
the proposed GANs. The CCA of the latent variables is shown to be an effective
method of controlling the generated data characteristics. We are able to model
the distribution of the time-series data without requiring domain-dependent
knowledge using the proposed method. Furthermore, it is possible to control the
characteristics of these data by analyzing the model trained using the proposed

evolution of clusters with a virial mass of $10^{14}\, h^{-1}M_{\odot}$ at

and density environment of a galaxy cluster. The stacked mass density profiles
of cluster-sized halos with a greater amount of pseudo evolution in the SO mass
shows the higher concentration ${\it and}$ greater linear bias parameter that
is a counter-example of the known secondary halo bias due to concentration on
the scale of clusters. We discuss how more concentrated clusters can show

driven by scalar factors loaded via functional loadings, and a mildly
cross-correlated idiosyncratic component. Our model and theory are developed in
a general Hilbert space setting that allows for mixed panels of functional and

exogenous variables, in addition to accurate prediction, it is also desired to
provide interpretable insights into the data. In this paper, we explore the
structure of LSTM recurrent neural networks to learn variable-wise hidden
states, with the aim to capture different dynamics in multi-variable time
series and distinguish the contribution of variables to the prediction. With
these variable-wise hidden states, a mixture attention mechanism is proposed to
model the generative process of the target. Then we develop associated training
methods to jointly learn network parameters, variable and temporal importance
w.r.t the prediction of the target variable. Extensive experiments on real
datasets demonstrate enhanced prediction performance by capturing the dynamics
of different variables. Meanwhile, we evaluate the interpretation results both

statistical complexity of neural recording data from fruit flies. First, we
connect statistical complexity to the flies' level of conscious arousal, which
is manipulated by general anesthesia (isoflurane). We show that the complexity
of even single channel time series data decreases under anesthesia. The
observed difference in complexity between the two states of conscious arousal
increases as higher orders of temporal correlations are taken into account. We
then go on to show that, in addition to reducing complexity, anesthesia also
modulates the informational structure between the forward- and reverse-time
neural signals. Specifically, using three distinct notions of temporal
asymmetry we show that anesthesia reduces temporal asymmetry on
information-theoretic and information-geometric grounds. In contrast to prior
work, our results show that: (1) Complexity differences can emerge at very

determine if the input falls into any patch. If yes, then the corresponding

statistical methods for analysing high-dimensional data and complex non-linear
relationships. A common approach for addressing dimensionality issues relies on
the use of static graphical structures for extracting the most significant
dependence interrelationships between the variables of interest. Recently,
Bayesian nonparametric techniques have become popular for modelling complex
phenomena in a flexible and efficient manner, but only few attempts have been
made in econometrics. In this paper, we provide an innovative Bayesian
nonparametric (BNP) time-varying graphical framework for making inference in
high-dimensional time series. We include a Bayesian nonparametric dependent
prior specification on the matrix of coefficients and the covariance matrix by
mean of a Time-Series DPP as in Nieto-Barajas et al. (2012). Following Billio
et al. (2019), our hierarchical prior overcomes over-parametrization and
over-fitting issues by clustering the vector autoregressive (VAR) coefficients
into groups and by shrinking the coefficients of each group toward a common
location. Our BNP timevarying VAR model is based on a spike-and-slab
construction coupled with dependent Dirichlet Process prior (DPP) and allows
to: (i) infer time-varying Granger causality networks from time series; (ii)

Following Billio\net al. (2019), our hierarchical prior overcomes over-parametrization and\nover-fitting issues by clustering the vector autoregressive (VAR) coefficients\ninto groups and by shrinking the coefficients of each group toward a common\nlocation. Our BNP timevarying VAR model is based on a spike-and-slab\nconstruction coupled with dependent Dirichlet Process prior (DPP) and allows\nto: (i) infer time-varying Granger causality networks from time series; (ii)\nflexibly model and cluster non-zero time-varying coefficients; (iii)\naccommodate for potential non-linearities.

gait-related health problems using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). The proposed
system takes a video of patients as the input and estimates their 3D body pose
using a DNN based method. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/rmehrizi/multi-view-pose-estimation. The resulting 3D body
pose time series are then analyzed in a classifier, which classifies input gait
videos into four different groups including Healthy, with Parkinsons disease,
Post Stroke patient, and with orthopedic problems. The proposed system removes
the requirement of complex and heavy equipment and large laboratory space, and
makes the system practical for home use. Moreover, it does not need domain
knowledge for feature engineering since it is capable of extracting semantic
and high level features from the input data. The experimental results showed
the classification accuracy of 56% to 96% for different groups. Furthermore,
only 1 out of 25 healthy subjects were misclassified (False positive), and only
1 out of 70 patients were classified as a healthy subject (False negative).
This study presents a starting point toward a powerful tool for automatic
classification of gait disorders and can be used as a basis for future
applications of Deep Learning in clinical gait analysis. Since the system uses
digital cameras as the only required equipment, it can be employed in domestic
environment of patients and elderly people for consistent gait monitoring and
early detection of gait alterations.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=8000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'The aim of this study is developing an automatic system for detection of\ngait-related health problems using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs).

deficient which limits the application of Riemannian concepts. In this article,

In this work I simulate several different reservoir computers and ask\nif the best performance really does come at this edge of chaos. I find that\nwhile it is possible to get optimum performance at the edge of chaos, there may\nalso be parameter values where the edge of chaos regime produces poor\nperformance.

Results were compared with the state-of-the-art methods\nand benchmarked with time-series methods in the case of handling the\nnon-uniform heat distribution issue. To further evaluate the performance of the\nmethod numerical simulations using transient heat transfer models were used to\ngenerate the 'theoretical' noise-free thermal images for comparison.\nSignificant performance improvement was found compared to the conventional\nmethods in both indoor and outdoor tests. This methodology proved to be capable\nto detect multi-size delamination using a single thermal image. It is robust to\nthe non-uniform temperature distribution. The limitations were discussed to\nrefine the applicability of the proposed procedure.""}","[{'name': 'Chongsheng Cheng'}, {'name': 'Ri Na'}, {'name': 'Zhigang Shen'}]",{'name': 'Zhigang Shen'},Zhigang Shen,10.1016/j.infrared.2018.12.039,"[{'title': 'doi', 'href': 'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.infrared.2018.12.039', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03721v1', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.03721v1', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,"Infrared Physics & Technology, 97, 162-176 (2019)","{'term': 'eess.IV', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'eess.IV', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",

Because of data limitations or by choice, the literature largely lacks multiple

investigate whether maturity details are informative of the network structure.
Applying the layered stochastic block model of Peixoto (2015) and other tools

layers in the Russian ILN, we find that collapsing all such layers consistently
obscures mesoscale structure. The optimal maturity granularity lies between
completely collapsing and completely separating the maturity layers and depends
on the development phase of the interbank market, with a more developed market
requiring more layers for optimal description. Closer inspection of the
inferred maturity bins associated with the optimal maturity granularity reveals
specific economic functions, from liquidity intermediation to financing.
Collapsing a network with multiple underlying maturity layers or extracting one
such layer, common in economic research, is therefore not only an incomplete

degree of heterogeneity in its clinical features, rate of progression, and
change of variables over time. In this work, we present a novel data-driven,
network-based Trajectory Profile Clustering (TPC) algorithm for 1)
identification of PD subtypes and 2) early prediction of disease progression in
individual patients. Our subtype identification is based not only on PD
variables, but also on their complex patterns of progression, providing a
useful tool for the analysis of large heterogenous, longitudinal data.
Specifically, we cluster patients based on the similarity of their trajectories
through a time series of bipartite networks connecting patients to demographic,
clinical, and genetic variables. We apply this approach to demographic and
clinical data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI)
dataset and identify 3 patient clusters, consistent with 3 distinct PD
subtypes, each with a characteristic variable progression profile.
Additionally, TPC predicts an individual patient's subtype and future disease
trajectory, based on baseline assessments. Application of our approach resulted
in 74% accurate subtype prediction in year 5 in a test/validation cohort.
Furthermore, we show that genetic variability can be integrated seamlessly in
our TPC approach. In summary, using PD as a model for chronic progressive
diseases, we show that TPC leverages high-dimensional longitudinal datasets for
subtype identification and early prediction of individual disease subtype. We
anticipate this approach will be broadly applicable to multidimensional

overcome this limitation with a study of the X-ray emitting late-type
main-sequence stars observed by XMM-Newton and Kepler. We measure rotation
periods from photometric variability in Kepler light curves. As activity
indicators, we adopt the X-ray luminosity, the number frequency of white-light
flares, the amplitude of the rotational photometric modulation, and the
standard deviation in the Kepler light curves. The search for X-ray flares in
the light curves provided by the EXTraS (Exploring the X-ray Transient and
variable Sky) FP-7 project allows us to identify simultaneous X-ray and
white-light flares. A careful selection of the X-ray sources in the Kepler
field yields 102 main-sequence stars with spectral types from A to M. We find
rotation periods for 74 X-ray emitting main-sequence stars, 22 of which without
period reported in the previous literature. In the X-ray activity/rotation
relation, we see evidence for the traditional distinction of a saturated and a
correlated part, the latter presenting a continuous decrease in activity
towards slower rotators. For the optical activity indicators the transition is
abrupt and located at a period of ~ 10 d but it can be probed only marginally

selection. We observe 7 bona-fide X-ray flares with evidence for a white-light

We searched for circumplanetary sodium and ionized calcium
gas around the disintegrating rocky exoplanet K2-22 b to constrain its gas-loss
and sublimation processes.
  Methods. We observed four transits of K2-22 b with X-shooter on ESO's Very
Large Telescope to obtain time-series of intermediate-resolution (R $\sim$
11400) spectra. Our analysis focused on the two sodium D lines (588.995 nm and
589.592 nm) and the Ca$^{+}$ triplet (849.802 nm, 854.209 nm and 866.214 nm).
Planet-related absorption is searched for in the velocity rest frame of the
planet, which changes from $\pm$66 kms$^{-1}$ during the transit.
  Results. Since K2-22 b exhibits highly variable transit depths, we analyzed
the individual nights and their average. By injecting signals we reached
5$\sigma$ upper-limits on the individual nights that ranged from 11% - 13% and
1.7% - 2.0% for the tail's sodium and ionized calcium absorption, respectively.
Night 1 was contaminated by its companion star so we considered weighted
averages with and without Night 1 and quote conservative 5$\sigma$ limits
without Night 1 of 9% and 1.4%, respectively. Assuming their mass fractions to
be similar to those in the Earth's crust, these limits correspond to scenarios
in which 0.04% and 35% of the transiting dust is sublimated and observed as
absorbing gas. However, this assumes the gas to be co-moving with the planet.
We show that for the high irradiation environment of K2-22 b, sodium and
ionized calcium could be quickly accelerated to 100s of km s$^{-1}$ due to
radiation pressure and entrainment by the stellar wind, making them much more

We searched for circumplanetary sodium and ionized calcium\ngas around the disintegrating rocky exoplanet K2-22 b to constrain its gas-loss\nand sublimation processes.\n  Methods. We observed four transits of K2-22 b with X-shooter on ESO's Very\nLarge Telescope to obtain time-series of intermediate-resolution (R $\\sim$\n11400) spectra. Our analysis focused on the two sodium D lines (588.995 nm and\n589.592 nm) and the Ca$^{+}$ triplet (849.802 nm, 854.209 nm and 866.214 nm).\nPlanet-related absorption is searched for in the velocity rest frame of the\nplanet, which changes from $\\pm$66 kms$^{-1}$ during the transit.\n  Results. Since K2-22 b exhibits highly variable transit depths, we analyzed\nthe individual nights and their average. By injecting signals we reached\n5$\\sigma$ upper-limits on the individual nights that ranged from 11% - 13% and\n1.7% - 2.0% for the tail's sodium and ionized calcium absorption, respectively.\nNight 1 was contaminated by its companion star so we considered weighted\naverages with and without Night 1 and quote conservative 5$\\sigma$ limits\nwithout Night 1 of 9% and 1.4%, respectively. Assuming their mass fractions to\nbe similar to those in the Earth's crust, these limits correspond to scenarios\nin which 0.04% and 35% of the transiting dust is sublimated and observed as\nabsorbing gas. However, this assumes the gas to be co-moving with the planet.\nWe show that for the high irradiation environment of K2-22 b, sodium and\nionized calcium could be quickly accelerated to 100s of km s$^{-1}$ due to\nradiation pressure and entrainment by the stellar wind, making them much more\ndifficult to detect. No evidence for such possibly broad and blue-shifted\nsignals are seen in our data.\n  Conclusions.

framework for large-scale quasi-stationary systems. The framework proposed
herein exploits the time series prediction capability of long short-term memory
(LSTM) recurrent neural network such that: (i) in the training phase, the LSTM
model is trained on the modal coefficients extracted from the high-resolution
data using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) transform, and (ii) in the
testing phase, the trained model predicts the modal coefficients for the total
time recursively based on the initial time history. To illustrate the
predictive performance of the proposed framework, the mean flow fields and time
series response of the field values are reconstructed from the predicted modal
coefficients by using an inverse POD transform. As a representative benchmark
test case, we consider a two-dimensional quasi-geostrophic (QG) ocean
circulation model which, in general, displays an enormous range of fluctuating
spatial and temporal scales. We first illustrate that the conventional Galerkin
projection based ROM of such systems requires a high number of POD modes to
obtain a stable flow physics. In addition, ROM-GP does not seem to capture the
intermittent bursts appearing in the dynamics of the first few most energetic
modes. However, the proposed non-intrusive ROM framework based on LSTM
(ROM-LSTM) yields a stable solution even for a small number of POD modes. We
also observe that the ROM-LSTM model is able to capture quasi-periodic
intermittent bursts accurately, and yields a stable and accurate mean flow
dynamics using the time history of a few previous time states, denoted as the
lookback time-window in this paper. Our findings suggest that the proposed ROM
framework is capable of predicting noisy nonlinear fluid flows in an extremely
efficient way compared to the conventional projection based ROM.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=8000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'In this study, we present a non-intrusive reduced order modeling (ROM)\nframework for large-scale quasi-stationary systems.

Tauri stars: RV Tau and DF Cyg. We aim at confirming their suspected binary
nature and deriving their orbital elements to investigate the impact of their
orbits on the evolution of these systems. This research is embedded into a
wider endeavour to study binary evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars.
Method: The high amplitude pulsations were cleaned from the radial-velocity
data to better constrain the orbital motion. We used Gaia DR2 parallaxes in
combination with the SEDs to compute their luminosities which were complemented
with the ones computed using a period-luminosity-colour relation. The ratio of
the circumstellar infrared flux to the photospheric flux obtained from the SEDs
was used to estimate the orbital inclination of each system. Results: DF Cyg
and RV Tau are binaries with spectroscopic orbital periods of 784$\pm$16 days
and 1198$\pm$17 days, respectively. These orbital periods are found to be
similar to the long-term periodic variability in the photometric time series,
indicating that binarity indeed explains the long-term photometric variability.
Both systems are surrounded by a circumbinary disc which is grazed by our
line-of-sight. As a result, the stellar photometric flux is extinct
periodically with the orbital period. Our derived orbital inclinations enabled
us to obtain accurate companion masses for DF Cyg and RV Tau. Analysis of the
Kepler photometry of DF Cyg revealed a power spectrum with side lobes around
the fundamental pulsation frequency. This modulation corresponds to the
spectroscopic orbital period and hence to the long-term photometric period.

series is a fundamental problem arising in a broad spectrum of applications.
Change point localization is particularly challenging when we only observe
low-dimensional projections of high-dimensional random variables. Specifically,
we assume we observe $\{ x_t, y_t\}_{t=1}^n$ where $ \{ x_t\}_{t=1}^n$ are
$p$-dimensional covariates, $\{y_t\}_{t=1}^n $ are the univariate responses
satisfying $E(y_t)=x_t^\top \beta_t^*\text{ for all }1\let\le n$ and that
$\{\beta_t^*\}_{t=1}^n $ are the unobserved regression parameters that change
over time in a piecewise constant manner. We first propose a novel algorithm
called Binary Segmentation through Estimated CUSUM statistics (BSE), which
computes the change points through direct estimates of the CUSUM statistics of
$\{\beta_t^*\}_{t=1}^n $. We show that BSE can consistently estimate the
unknown location of the change points, achieving error bounds of order $O
(\log(p)/n) $. To the best of our knowledge, this is a significant improvement,
as the state-of-the-art methods are only shown to achieve error bounds of order
$O(\log(p)/\sqrt n)$ in the multiple change point setting. However, BSE can be
computationally costly. To overcome this limitation, we introduce another
algorithm called Binary Segmentation through Lasso Estimators (BSLE). We show
that BSLE can consistently localize change points with a slightly worse
localization error rate compared to BSE, but BSLE is much more computationally
efficient. Finally, we leverage the insights gained from BSE to develop a novel
""local screening"" algorithm that can input a coarse estimate of change point
locations together with the observed data and efficiently refine that estimate,

an overall trend whereby the differential rotation is distributed in two $H$
regimes segregated by the degree of asymmetry $A$, where $H$-index denotes the
global Hurst exponent which is used as a measure of long-term memory of time

Then, we propose LogSparse Transformer with only $O(L(\\log L)^{2})$\nmemory cost, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine\ngranularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget.\nOur experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets show that it\ncompares favorably to the state-of-the-art.'}","[{'name': 'Shiyang Li'}, {'name': 'Xiaoyong Jin'}, {'name': 'Yao Xuan'}, {'name': 'Xiyou Zhou'}, {'name': 'Wenhu Chen'}, {'name': 'Yu-Xiang Wang'}, {'name': 'Xifeng Yan'}]",{'name': 'Xifeng Yan'},Xifeng Yan,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00235v3', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.00235v3', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",To appear in the proceeding of NeurIPS 2019,,"{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",

an evolving graph dataset generated from YouTube real-world interactions.
YoutubeGraph-Dyn provides intra-day time granularity (with 416 snapshots taken
every 6 hours for a period of 104 days), multi-modal relationships that capture
different aspects of the data, multiple attributes including timestamped,
non-timestamped, word embeddings, and integers. Our data collection methodology
emphasizes the creation of time evolving graphs from non-timestamped data. In
this paper, we provide various graph statistics of YoutubeGraph-Dyn and test
state-of-the-art graph clustering algorithms to detect community migration, and
time series analysis and recurrent neural network algorithms to forecast
non-timestamped data.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=8000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Datasets to study the temporal evolution of graphs are scarce.

A dual input,\nmulti-output convolutional neural network is designed to predict the parameters\nof a perturbing body given the known parameters and measured perturbation\n(O-C). There is evidence for 3 new multi-planet candidates (WASP-18, WASP-126,\nTOI-193) with non-transiting companions using the 2 minute cadence observations\nfrom TESS. This approach can be used to identify multi-planet systems and stars\nin need of longer radial velocity and photometric follow-up than those already\nperformed.""}",[{'name': 'Kyle A.

curves for a large fraction of the sky, such that many new variable stars are
being discovered. However, some stars have periodic variability with periods of
order minutes and require high-cadence photometry to probe the physical
mechanisms responsible. A cadence of less than a minute is often required to
remove Nyquist ambiguities and confirm rapid variability which forces observers
to obtain high-cadence ground-based photometry. Aims. We aim to provide a
modern software package to reduce ground-based photometric time series data and
deliver optimised (differential) light curves. To produce high-quality light
curves, which maximise the amplitude signal-to-noise ratio of short-period
variability in a Fourier spectrum, we require adaptive elliptical aperture
photometry as this represents a significant advantage compared to aperture
photometry using circular apertures of fixed radii. Methods. The methodology of

used in machine learning to learn from data streams exhibiting temporal
dependencies. To break the black box nature of such models it is important to
understand the dynamical features of the input driving time series that are
formed in the state space. We propose a framework for rigorous analysis of such
state representations in vanishing memory state space models such as echo state
networks (ESN). In particular, we consider the state space a temporal feature
space and the readout mapping from the state space a kernel machine operating
in that feature space. We show that: (1) The usual ESN strategy of randomly
generating input-to-state, as well as state coupling leads to shallow memory
time series representations, corresponding to cross-correlation operator with
fast exponentially decaying coefficients; (2) Imposing symmetry on dynamic
coupling yields a constrained dynamic kernel matching the input time series
with straightforward exponentially decaying motifs or exponentially decaying
motifs of the highest frequency; (3) Simple cycle high-dimensional reservoir
topology specified only through two free parameters can implement deep memory
dynamic kernels with a rich variety of matching motifs. We quantify richness of
feature representations imposed by dynamic kernels and demonstrate that for

To break the black box nature of such models it is important to\nunderstand the dynamical features of the input driving time series that are\nformed in the state space. We propose a framework for rigorous analysis of such\nstate representations in vanishing memory state space models such as echo state\nnetworks (ESN). In particular, we consider the state space a temporal feature\nspace and the readout mapping from the state space a kernel machine operating\nin that feature space. We show that: (1) The usual ESN strategy of randomly\ngenerating input-to-state, as well as state coupling leads to shallow memory\ntime series representations, corresponding to cross-correlation operator with\nfast exponentially decaying coefficients; (2) Imposing symmetry on dynamic\ncoupling yields a constrained dynamic kernel matching the input time series\nwith straightforward exponentially decaying motifs or exponentially decaying\nmotifs of the highest frequency; (3) Simple cycle high-dimensional reservoir\ntopology specified only through two free parameters can implement deep memory\ndynamic kernels with a rich variety of matching motifs. We quantify richness of\nfeature representations imposed by dynamic kernels and demonstrate that for\ndynamic kernel associated with cycle reservoir topology, the kernel richness\nundergoes a phase transition close to the edge of stability.'}",[{'name': 'Peter Tino'}],{'name': 'Peter Tino'},Peter Tino,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.06382v3', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.06382v3', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]","45 pages, 17 figures, accepted","JMLR, 2020","{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",

In\naddition, the way that the variable layer width design of the parameter\nselection sub-network and the introduction of transfer learning make the model\nbe with more expandability. Through experiments, it is found that ATSDLN can\nselect appropriate anomaly detector and run-time parameters, and have strong\nexpandability, which can quickly transfer. We investigate the performance of\nATSDLN in public data sets, our methods outperform other methods in most cases\nwith higher effect and better adaptation.

used for applications with time-series and sequential data. Recently, there has
been a strong interest in executing RNNs on embedded devices. However,
difficulties have arisen because RNN requires high computational capability and
a large memory space. In this paper, we review existing implementations of RNN
models on embedded platforms and discuss the methods adopted to overcome the
limitations of embedded systems.
  We will define the objectives of mapping RNN algorithms on embedded platforms
and the challenges facing their realization. Then, we explain the components of
RNN models from an implementation perspective. We also discuss the
optimizations applied to RNNs to run efficiently on embedded platforms.
Finally, we compare the defined objectives with the implementations and
highlight some open research questions and aspects currently not addressed for
embedded RNNs.
  Overall, applying algorithmic optimizations to RNN models and decreasing the
memory access overhead is vital to obtain high efficiency. To further increase
the implementation efficiency, we point up the more promising optimizations
that could be applied in future research. Additionally, this article observes
that high performance has been targeted by many implementations, while

Then, we explain the components of\nRNN models from an implementation perspective.

To further increase\nthe implementation efficiency, we point up the more promising optimizations\nthat could be applied in future research.

rotation of pulsars. For the Vela pulsar and PSR J0537-6910, the glitch sizes

to the handful of other pulsars with enough glitches for such a study.
Moreover, PSR J0537-6910 is the only pulsar showing a strong positive
correlation between the size of each glitch and the waiting time until the
following one.
  We attempt to understand this behavior through a detailed study of the

at least ten detected glitches. We model the distributions of glitch sizes and
times between consecutive glitches for this sample and perform Monte Carlo
simulations to explore two hypotheses that could explain why the correlation is
so much weaker in other pulsars than in PSR J0537-6910.
  We confirm the above results for the Vela pulsar and PSR J0537-6910, and
verify that the latter is the only pulsar with a strong correlation between
glitch size and waiting time to the following glitch. For the remaining six
pulsars, the waiting time distributions are best fitted by exponentials, and
the size distributions either by power laws, exponentials, or log-normal

its power production as well as its structural stability. Here we present an
incoming flow measurement of a utility-scale turbine at the high
spatio-temporal resolution, using super-large-scale particle image velocimetry
(SLPIV) with natural snowflakes. The datasets include over a one-hour duration
of incoming flow with a field of view of 85 m (vertical) x 40 m (streamwise)
centered at 0.2 rotor diameter upstream of the turbine. The mean flow shows the
presence of the induction zone and a distinct region with enhanced vertical
velocity. Time series of nacelle sonic anemometer and SLPIV measured streamwise
velocity outside the induction zone show generally matched trends with
time-varying discrepancies potentially due to the induction effect and the flow
acceleration around the nacelle. These discrepancies between the two signals,
characterized by the sonic-SLPIV velocity ratio, is normally distributed and is
less than unity 85% of the time. The velocity ratio first decreases with
increasing wind speed up to around the rated speed of the turbine, then
plateaus, and finally rises with a further increase in wind speed. With
conditional sampling, the distribution of the velocity ratio shows that larger
yaw error leads to an increase in both the mean and the spread of the
distribution. Moreover, as the incident angle of the incoming flow changes from
negative to positive (i.e. from pointing downward to upward), the velocity
ratio first decreases as the angle approaches zero. With further increase of
the incidence angle, the ratio then plateaus and fluctuations are augmented.

an excellent probe of the extended and possibly evaporating atmospheres of
close-in transiting planets. This has already resulted in detections of this
triplet in the atmospheres of a handful of planets, both from space and from
the ground. However, while a strong signal is expected for the hot Jupiter HD
209458 b, only upper limits have been obtained so far. Aims: Our goal is to
measure the helium excess absorption from HD 209458 b and assess the extended
atmosphere of the planet and possible evaporation. Methods: We obtained new
high-resolution spectral transit time-series of HD 209458 b using CARMENES at
the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope, targeting the He I triplet at 10830 \r{A} at a
spectral resolving power of 80 400. The observed spectra were corrected for
stellar absorption lines using out of transit data, for telluric absorption
using the molecfit software, and for the sky emission lines using simultaneous
sky measurements through a second fibre. Results: We detect He I absorption at
a level of 0.91 $\pm$ 0.10 % (9 $\sigma$) at mid-transit. The absorption
follows the radial velocity change of the planet during transit, unambiguously
identifying the planet as the source of the absorption. The core of the
absorption exhibits a net blueshift of 1.8 $\pm$ 1.3 km s$^{-1}$. Possible
low-level excess absorption is seen further blueward from the main absorption
near the centre of the transit, which could be caused by an extended tail.
However, this needs to be confirmed. Conclusions: Our results further support a
close relationship between the strength of planetary absorption in the helium

workshop tutorial, we motivate the opportunity to reconcile the cause of safety

series graph of over 200K Bitcoin transactions (nodes), 234K directed payment
flows (edges), and 166 node features, including ones based on non-public data;

available in any cryptocurrency. We share results from a binary classification
task predicting illicit transactions using variations of Logistic Regression
(LR), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCN), with GCN being of special interest as an emergent new method
for capturing relational information. The results show the superiority of
Random Forest (RF), but also invite algorithmic work to combine the respective
powers of RF and graph methods. Lastly, we consider visualization for analysis
and explainability, which is difficult given the size and dynamism of
real-world transaction graphs, and we offer a simple prototype capable of
navigating the graph and observing model performance on illicit activity over

A*, with peak luminosities more than 600 x and 245 x greater than the quiescent

--- it lasts 5.7 ksec ($\sim 2$ hours), with a rapid rise time of 1500 sec and
a decay time of 2500 sec. The second flare lasts 3.4 ksec, with rise and decay
times of 1700 sec and 1400 sec. These luminous flares are significantly harder
than quiescence: the first has a power law spectral index $\Gamma = 2.06\pm

3.0\pm0.2$ for the quiescent accretion flow. These spectral indices (as well as
the flare hardness ratios) are consistent with previously-detected Sgr A*
flares, suggesting that bright and faint flares arise from similar physical
processes. Leveraging the brightest flare's long duration and high

power at a frequency of $\nu \approx 3$ mHz, but show that it is an
instrumental artifact and not of astrophysical origin. We find no other

  This work introduces a parametric polynomial kernel method that can be used
for inferring the future behaviour of Ordinary Differential Equation models,
including chaotic dynamical systems, from observations. Using numerical
integration techniques, parametric representations of Ordinary Differential
Equations can be learnt using Backpropagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent.
The polynomial technique presented here is based on a nonparametric method,
kernel ridge regression. However, the time complexity of nonparametric kernel
ridge regression scales cubically with the number of training data points. Our
parametric polynomial method avoids this manifestation of the curse of
dimensionality, which becomes particularly relevant when working with large
time series data sets.
  Two numerical demonstrations are presented. First, a simple regression test
case is used to illustrate the method and to compare the performance with
standard Artificial Neural Network techniques. Second, a more substantial test
case is the inference of a chaotic spatio-temporal dynamical system, the
Lorenz--Emanuel system, from observations. Our method was able to successfully
track the future behaviour of the system over time periods much larger than the

individual voxels within regions of interest (ROIs). In certain cases, this
spatial aggregation implies a loss of valuable functional and anatomical
information about smaller subsets of voxels that drive the ROI level
connectivity. We use two recently published graphical search methods to
identify subsets of voxels that are highly responsible for the connectivity
between larger ROIs. To illustrate the procedure, we apply both methods to
longitudinal high-resolution resting state fMRI data from regions in the medial
temporal lobe from a single individual. Both methods recovered similar subsets
of voxels within larger ROIs of entorhinal cortex and hippocampus subfields
that also show spatial consistency across different scanning sessions and
across hemispheres. In contrast to standard functional connectivity methods,
both algorithms applied here are robust against false positive connections
produced by common causes and indirect paths (in contrast to Pearson's
correlation) and common effect conditioning (in contrast to partial correlation
based approaches). These algorithms allow for identification of subregions of
voxels driving the connectivity between regions of interest, recovering

leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and cost overruns in the Intensive Care
Unit (ICU). Early prediction of sepsis can improve situational awareness
amongst clinicians and facilitate timely, protective interventions. While the
application of predictive analytics in ICU patients has shown early promising
results, much of the work has been encumbered by high false-alarm rates.
Efforts to improve specificity have been limited by several factors, most
notably the difficulty of labeling sepsis onset time and the low prevalence of
septic-events in the ICU. Here, we present DeepAISE (Deep Artificial
Intelligence Sepsis Expert), a recurrent neural survival model for the early
prediction of sepsis. We show that by coupling a clinical criterion for
defining sepsis onset time with a treatment policy (e.g., initiation of
antibiotics within one hour of meeting the criterion), one may rank the
relative utility of various criteria through offline policy evaluation. Given
the optimal criterion, DeepAISE automatically learns predictive features
related to higher-order interactions and temporal patterns among clinical risk
factors that maximize the data likelihood of observed time to septic events.
DeepAISE has been incorporated into a clinical workflow, which provides
real-time hourly sepsis risk scores. A comparative study of four baseline
models indicates that DeepAISE produces the most accurate predictions (AUC=0.90

Early prediction of sepsis can improve situational awareness\namongst clinicians and facilitate timely, protective interventions. While the\napplication of predictive analytics in ICU patients has shown early promising\nresults, much of the work has been encumbered by high false-alarm rates.\nEfforts to improve specificity have been limited by several factors, most\nnotably the difficulty of labeling sepsis onset time and the low prevalence of\nseptic-events in the ICU. Here, we present DeepAISE (Deep Artificial\nIntelligence Sepsis Expert), a recurrent neural survival model for the early\nprediction of sepsis. We show that by coupling a clinical criterion for\ndefining sepsis onset time with a treatment policy (e.g., initiation of\nantibiotics within one hour of meeting the criterion), one may rank the\nrelative utility of various criteria through offline policy evaluation. Given\nthe optimal criterion, DeepAISE automatically learns predictive features\nrelated to higher-order interactions and temporal patterns among clinical risk\nfactors that maximize the data likelihood of observed time to septic events.\nDeepAISE has been incorporated into a clinical workflow, which provides\nreal-time hourly sepsis risk scores. A comparative study of four baseline\nmodels indicates that DeepAISE produces the most accurate predictions (AUC=0.90\nand 0.87) and the lowest false alarm rates (FAR=0.20 and 0.26) in two separate\ncohorts (internal and external, respectively), while simultaneously producing\ninterpretable representations of the clinical time series and risk factors.'}","[{'name': 'Supreeth P.

This remarkable nonlinear phenomenon of self-sustained oscillatory motion
underlies important rhythmic processes in nature and electrical engineering.
Relaxation oscillations in a real system are usually coupled to environmental
noise, which further enriches their dynamics, but makes theoretical analysis of
such systems and determination of the equation's parameter values a difficult
task. In a companion paper we have proposed an analytic approach to a similar
problem for another classical nonlinear model, the bistable Duffing oscillator.
Here we extend our techniques to the case of the Van der Pol equation driven by
white noise. We analyze the statistics of solutions and propose a method to
estimate parameter values from the oscillator's time series. We use

Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) are time variations in the energy
emission during a flare that are observed on both the Sun and other stars and
thus have the potential to link the physics of solar and stellar flares. Aims.
To characterise the QPPs detected in an X-ray flare on the solar analogue, EK
Draconis, which was observed by XMM-Newton. Methods. We use wavelet and
autocorrelation techniques to identify the QPPs in a detrended version of the
flare. We also fit a model to the flare based on an exponential decay combined
with a decaying sinusoid. The flare is examined in multiple energy bands.
Results. A statistically significant QPP is observed in the X-ray energy band
of 0.2-12.0 keV with a periodicity of 76+/-2 min. When this energy band is
split, a statistically significant QPP is observed in the low-energy band
(0.2-1.0 keV) with a periodicity of 73+/-2 min and in the high-energy band
(1.0-12.0 keV) with a periodicity of 82+/-2 min. When fitting a model to the
time series the phases of the signals are also found to be significantly
different in the two energy bands (with a difference of 1.8+/-0.2 rad) and the
high-energy band is found to lead the low-energy band. Furthermore, the first
peak in the cross-correlation between the detrended residuals of the low- and
high-energy bands is offset from zero by more than 3{\sigma} (4.1+/-1.3 min).
Both energy bands produce statistically significant regions in the wavelet
spectrum, whose periods are consistent with those listed above. However, the
peaks are broad in both the wavelet and global power spectra, with the wavelet
showing evidence for a drift in period with time, and the difference in period
obtained is not significant. etc...","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=8000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Context.

  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides non-invasive measures
of neuronal activity using an endogenous Blood Oxygenation-Level Dependent
(BOLD) contrast. This article introduces a nonlinear dimensionality reduction
(Locally Linear Embedding) to extract informative measures of the underlying
neuronal activity from BOLD time-series. The method is validated using the
Leave-One-Out-Cross-Validation (LOOCV) accuracy of classifying psychiatric
diagnoses using resting-state and task-related fMRI.
  Methods:
  Locally Linear Embedding of BOLD time-series (into each voxel's respective
tensor) was used to optimise feature selection. This uses Gau\ss' Principle of
Least Constraint to conserve quantities over both space and time. This
conservation was assessed using LOOCV to greedily select time points in an
incremental fashion on training data that was categorised in terms of
psychiatric diagnoses.
  Findings:
  The embedded fMRI gave highly diagnostic performances (> 80%) on eleven
publicly-available datasets containing healthy controls and patients with
either Schizophrenia, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), or
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Furthermore, unlike the original fMRI data
before or after using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for artefact
reduction, the embedded fMRI furnished significantly better than chance

computer vision applications, such as synthesizing realistic motions or
recognizing actions. Recent research has shown that such problems can be
approached by learning a natural motion manifold using deep learning to address
the shortcomings of traditional data-driven approaches. However, previous
methods can be sub-optimal for two reasons. First, the skeletal information has
not been fully utilized for feature extraction. Unlike images, it is difficult
to define spatial proximity in skeletal motions in the way that deep networks
can be applied. Second, motion is time-series data with strong multi-modal
temporal correlations. A frame could be followed by several candidate frames
leading to different motions; long-range dependencies exist where a number of
frames in the beginning correlate to a number of frames later. Ineffective
modeling would either under-estimate the multi-modality and variance, resulting
in featureless mean motion or over-estimate them resulting in jittery motions.
In this paper, we propose a new deep network to tackle these challenges by
creating a natural motion manifold that is versatile for many applications. The
network has a new spatial component for feature extraction. It is also equipped
with a new batch prediction model that predicts a large number of frames at
once, such that long-term temporally-based objective functions can be employed
to correctly learn the motion multi-modality and variances. With our system,
long-duration motions can be predicted/synthesized using an open-loop setup
where the motion retains the dynamics accurately. It can also be used for
denoising corrupted motions and synthesizing new motions with given control
signals. We demonstrate that our system can create superior results comparing
to existing work in multiple applications.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=8000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'Data-driven modeling of human motions is ubiquitous in computer graphics and\ncomputer vision applications, such as synthesizing realistic motions or\nrecognizing actions.

normal distribution. Then we find the set of decoupled SDEs that admit the
reference measure as the invariant measure, and also closely match the spectrum

series as the evolution of a stochastic system observed through the lens of a
nonlinear map. We demonstrate the application of this framework in Lorenz-96

terms of solar activity and space radiation environment especially due to the

These particle fluxes constitute a major hazard to the astronauts and also to
the critical electronic components of the spacecraft. Recent data on the HZE

these cosmic ray fluxes occur with a time lag of about a year of the

series forecasting. Therefore, three main gaps in previous works are addressed
including, analyzing various subsets of top forecasters as inputs for
meta-learners; evaluating the effect of forecasting error measures; and
assessing the role of the dimensionality of the feature space on the
forecasting errors of meta-learners. All of these objectives are achieved with
the help of a diverse state-of-the-art pool of forecasters and meta-learners.
For this purpose, first, a pool of forecasting algorithms is implemented on the
NN5 competition dataset and ranked based on the two error measures. Then, six
machine-learning classifiers known as meta-learners, are trained on the
extracted features of the time series in order to assign the most suitable
forecasting method for the various subsets of the pool of forecasters.
Furthermore, two-dimensionality reduction methods are implemented in order to
investigate the role of feature space dimension on the performance of
meta-learners. In general, it was found that meta-learners were able to defeat
all of the individual benchmark forecasters; this performance was improved even
after applying the feature selection method.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=8000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'One of the challenging questions in time series forecasting is how to find\nthe best algorithm.

mechanism to satellite-based agricultural monitoring. It augments existing
classification models by an additional stopping probability based on the
previously seen information. This mechanism is end-to-end trainable and derives
its stopping decision solely from the observed satellite data. We show results
on field parcels in central Europe where sufficient ground truth data is
available for an empiric evaluation of the results with local phenological
information obtained from authorities. We observe that the recurrent neural
network outfitted with this early classification mechanism was able to
distinguish the many of the crop types before the end of the vegetative period.

The\ndesigned changepoint tests are shown to be consistent and involve neither\nnuisance parameters nor tuning constants, which makes the testing procedures\neffortlessly applicable. A changepoint estimator is also introduced and its\nconsistency is proved. A boundary issue is avoided, meaning that the\nchangepoint can be detected when being close to the extremities of the\nobservation regime. As a theoretical basis for the developed methods, a weak\ninvariance principle for the smallest singular value of the data matrix is\nprovided, assuming weakly dependent and non-stationary errors. The results are\npresented in a simulation study, which demonstrates computational efficiency of\nthe techniques. The completely data-driven tests are illustrated through a\ncalibration problem, however, the methodology can be applied to other areas\nsuch as clinical measurements, dietary assessment, computational psychometrics,\nor environmental toxicology as manifested in the paper.'}",[{'name': 'Michal Pešta'}],{'name': 'Michal Pešta'},Michal Pešta,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10628v2', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10628v2', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,,"{'term': 'math.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'math.ST', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.TH', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': '62F03, 62E20, 62F05, 62M10, 15A18, 65F15, 62J99, 60G99, 62F12', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",

The method leverages the\nrecently developed Union of Intersections (UoI) algorithmic framework for\nflexible, modular, and scalable feature selection and estimation that allows\ncontrol of false discovery and false omission in feature selection while\nmaintaining low bias and low variance. This paper demonstrates the superior\nperformance of the UoI-VAR algorithm compared with other methods in simulation\nstudies, exhibits its application in data analysis, and illustrates its good\nalgorithmic scalability in multi-node distributed memory implementations.'}","[{'name': 'Trevor Ruiz'}, {'name': 'Mahesh Balasubramanian'}, {'name': 'Kristofer E.

For mixtures of\nspherical Gaussians with common variance $\\sigma^2$, the bound takes the simple\nform $\\sqrt{n}\\sigma$. We evaluate our method on one- and two-dimensional\nsignals.

The approach allows for ranking of the relative effect of\ndifferent bundles and is a tool to recommend those most likely to succeed. This\nstudy shows that a set of policies balancing Medication Assisted Treatment,\nNaloxone Access, Good Samaritan Laws, Medication Assisted Treatment,\nPrescription Drug Monitoring Programs and legalization of medical marijuana\nleads to a reduced number of overdose deaths, but not until its second year in\nforce.'}","[{'name': 'Jarrod Olson'}, {'name': 'Po-Hsu Allen Chen'}, {'name': 'Marissa White'}, {'name': 'Nicole Brennan'}, {'name': 'Ning Gong'}]",{'name': 'Ning Gong'},Ning Gong,,"[{'href': 'http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.01936v3', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}, {'title': 'pdf', 'href': 'http://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01936v3', 'rel': 'related', 'type': 'application/pdf'}]",,,"{'term': 'stat.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom'}","[{'term': 'stat.AP', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'cs.LG', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'econ.EM', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': 'stat.ML', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}, {'term': '62H12', 'scheme': 'http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom', 'label': None}]",

detecting Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone of a star similar to the Sun
in spectral type and activity level. It is crucial to estimate if this
conclusion remain true for other stars with current correction methods. We
built realistic time series in RV and chromospheric emission for old
main-sequence F6-K4 stars. The stellar parameters are spectral type, activity
level, rotation period, cycle period and amplitude, latitude coverage, and spot
constrast, which we chose to be in ranges that are compatible with our current
knowledge. This very large set of synthetic time series allowed us to study the
effect of the parameters on the RV jitter and how the different contributions
to the RV are affected in this first analysis of the data set. The RV jitter
was used to provide a first-order detection limit for each time series and
different temporal samplings. We find that the coverage in latitude of the
activity pattern and the cycle amplitudes have a strong effect on the RV
jitter, as has stellar inclination. RV jitter trends with B-V and LogR'HK are
similar to observations, but activity cannot be responsible for RV jitter
larger than 2-3 m/s for very quiet stars: this observed jitter is therefore
likely to be due to other causes. We show that based on the RV jitter that is
associated with each time series and using a simple criterion, a planet with
one Earth mass and a period of one to two years probably cannot be detected
with current analysis techniques, except for the lower mass stars in our
sample, but many observations would be required. The effect of inclination is
critical. The results are very important in the context of future RV follow-ups
of transit detections of such planets. A significant improvement of analysis

It is crucial to estimate if this\nconclusion remain true for other stars with current correction methods. We\nbuilt realistic time series in RV and chromospheric emission for old\nmain-sequence F6-K4 stars. The stellar parameters are spectral type, activity\nlevel, rotation period, cycle period and amplitude, latitude coverage, and spot\nconstrast, which we chose to be in ranges that are compatible with our current\nknowledge. This very large set of synthetic time series allowed us to study the\neffect of the parameters on the RV jitter and how the different contributions\nto the RV are affected in this first analysis of the data set. The RV jitter\nwas used to provide a first-order detection limit for each time series and\ndifferent temporal samplings. We find that the coverage in latitude of the\nactivity pattern and the cycle amplitudes have a strong effect on the RV\njitter, as has stellar inclination. RV jitter trends with B-V and LogR'HK are\nsimilar to observations, but activity cannot be responsible for RV jitter\nlarger than 2-3 m/s for very quiet stars: this observed jitter is therefore\nlikely to be due to other causes. We show that based on the RV jitter that is\nassociated with each time series and using a simple criterion, a planet with\none Earth mass and a period of one to two years probably cannot be detected\nwith current analysis techniques, except for the lower mass stars in our\nsample, but many observations would be required. The effect of inclination is\ncritical. The results are very important in the context of future RV follow-ups\nof transit detections of such planets.

do not meet the criteria for apnea or hypopnea, and are more challenging to

short-term memory (BiLSTM) classifier and 465 multi-domain features, extracted
from multimodal clinical time series. The features consist of a set of

high co-added signal levels due to a gain variation caused by our warm detector
control electronics. The photometric precision was improved up to 12.8ppm after
correcting for the gain drift. We also translated the photometric precision to

densified pupil spectrograph is used in transit observations. We found that the

The definition is based on ranking curves using a notion of functional depth.
This approach allows us to study the curves of the number of records over time.
We focus on functional time series and apply ideas from univariate time series

unit root test is proposed as an application of functional record theory.
Through a Monte Carlo study, different scenarios of functional processes are
simulated to evaluate the performance of the unit root test. The generalized
record definition is applied on two different datasets: Annual mortality rates

result of data from CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS and have been widely used to study
stellar activity. They provide information integrated over the stellar disk,
hence many degeneracies between spots and plages or sizes and contrasts. Our
aim is to understand how to relate photometric variability to physical
parameters in order to help the interpretation of these observations. We
computed a large number of synthetic time series of brightness variations for
old MS stars within the F6-K4 range, using consistent modeling for radial
velocity, astrometry, and LogR'HK. We analyzed these time series to study the
effect of the star spectral type on brightness variability, the relationship
between brightness variability and LogR'HK, the interpretation of brightness
variability as a function of spot and plage properties, and the spot-dominated
or plage-dominated regimes. Within our range of activity levels, the brightness
variability increases toward low-mass stars, as suggested by Kepler results.
Brightness variability roughly correlates to LogR'HK level, but with a large
dispersion, caused by spot contrast and inclination. It is also directly
related to the number of structures, and we show that it cannot be interpreted
solely in terms of spot sizes. In the activity range of old main-sequence
stars, we can obtain both spot or plage dominated regimes, as in observation.
The same star can be observed in both regimes depending on inclination. Only
strong correlations between LogR'HK and brightness variability are significant.
Our realistic time series proves to be extremely useful when interpreting
observations and understanding their limitations, most notably in terms of
activity interpretation. Inclination is crucial and affects many properties,
such as amplitudes and the respective role of spots and plages.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=8000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': ""High-precision time series have recently become available for many stars as a\nresult of data from CoRoT, Kepler, and TESS and have been widely used to study\nstellar activity.

We aim to determine the geometry, density gradient, and velocity
structure of jets in post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binaries. Methods.
Our high cadence time series of high-resolution optical spectra of jet-creating
post-AGB binary systems provide us with a unique tomography of the jet. We
determine the spatio-kinematic structure of the jets based on these data by
fitting the synthetic spectral line profiles created by our model to the
observed, orbital phase-resolved, H{\alpha}-line profiles of these systems. The
fitting routine is provided with an initial spectrum and is allowed to test
three configurations, derived from three specific jet launching models: a
stellar jet launched by the star, an X-wind, and a disk wind configuration. We
apply a Markov-chain Monte Carlo routine in order to fit our model to the
observations. Our fitting code is tested on the post-AGB binary IRAS19135+3937.
Results. We find that a model using the stellar jet configuration gives a
marginally better fit to our observations. The jet has a wide half-opening
angle of about 76 degrees and reaches velocities up to 870 km/s. Conclusions.
Our methodology is successful in determining some parameters for jets in
post-AGB binaries. The model for IRAS19135+3937 includes a transparent, low
density inner region (for a half-opening angle < 40 degrees). The source

We aim to determine the geometry, density gradient, and velocity\nstructure of jets in post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binaries. Methods.\nOur high cadence time series of high-resolution optical spectra of jet-creating\npost-AGB binary systems provide us with a unique tomography of the jet. We\ndetermine the spatio-kinematic structure of the jets based on these data by\nfitting the synthetic spectral line profiles created by our model to the\nobserved, orbital phase-resolved, H{\\alpha}-line profiles of these systems. The\nfitting routine is provided with an initial spectrum and is allowed to test\nthree configurations, derived from three specific jet launching models: a\nstellar jet launched by the star, an X-wind, and a disk wind configuration. We\napply a Markov-chain Monte Carlo routine in order to fit our model to the\nobservations. Our fitting code is tested on the post-AGB binary IRAS19135+3937.\nResults. We find that a model using the stellar jet configuration gives a\nmarginally better fit to our observations. The jet has a wide half-opening\nangle of about 76 degrees and reaches velocities up to 870 km/s. Conclusions.\nOur methodology is successful in determining some parameters for jets in\npost-AGB binaries. The model for IRAS19135+3937 includes a transparent, low\ndensity inner region (for a half-opening angle < 40 degrees). The source\nfeeding the accretion disk around the companion is most likely the circumbinary\ndisk.

While many modern, often\nhand-crafted RNNs rely on complex memory cells (which have internal recurrent\nconnections that only span a single time step) operating under the assumption\nthat these sufficiently latch information and handle long term dependencies,\nour results show that networks evolved with deep recurrent connections perform\nsignificantly better than those without. More importantly, in some cases, the\nbest performing RNNs consisted of only simple neurons and deep time skip\nconnections, without any memory cells. These results strongly suggest that\nutilizing deep time skip connections in RNNs for time series data prediction\nnot only deserves further, dedicated study, but also demonstrate the potential\nof neuro-evolution as a means to better study, understand, and train effective\nRNNs.'}","[{'name': 'Travis J.

models due to low noise-to-signal ratio, non-stationarity, and partial
observability. Non-deliverable-forwards (NDF), a derivatives contract used in
foreign exchange (FX) trading, presents additional difficulty in the form of
long-term planning required for an effective selection of start and end date of
the contract. In this work, we focus on tackling the problem of NDF tenor
selection by leveraging high-dimensional sequential data consisting of spot
rates, technical indicators and expert tenor patterns. To this end, we
construct a dataset from the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC) NDF
data that includes a comprehensive list of NDF volumes and daily spot rates for
64 FX pairs. We introduce WaveATTentionNet (WATTNet), a novel temporal
convolution (TCN) model for spatio-temporal modeling of highly multivariate
time series, and validate it across NDF markets with varying degrees of
dissimilarity between the training and test periods in terms of volatility and
general market regimes. The proposed method achieves a significant positive
return on investment (ROI) in all NDF markets under analysis, outperforming

avoid this drawback of DP, we consider datasets containing almost periodic time

independent across periods. Our interest in these datasets is motivated by
that, for reporting on private periodic time series, we do not need to divide
the privacy budget across the entire, possibly infinite, horizon. Instead, for
periodic time series, we generate DP reports for the first period and report
the same DP reports periodically. In practice, however, exactly periodic time
series do not exist as the data always contains small variations due to random

repeat the same daily pattern with slight variations due to minor changes to
the habits of the individuals. The underlying periodic pattern is a function of
the private information of the households. It might be desired to protect the
privacy of households by not leaking information about the recurring patterns

networks (RNNs) is a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming process. To
address this challenge, we propose a novel neuro-evolution algorithm based on

directly optimizing RNN topologies. The procedure selects from multiple modern
recurrent cell types such as Delta-RNN, GRU, LSTM, MGU and UGRNN cells, as well
as recurrent connections which may span multiple layers and/or steps of time.
In order to introduce an inductive bias that encourages the formation of
sparser synaptic connectivity patterns, we investigate several variations of
the core algorithm. We do so primarily by formulating different functions that
drive the underlying pheromone simulation process (which mimic L1 and L2
regularization in standard machine learning) as well as by introducing ant
agents with specialized roles (inspired by how real ant colonies operate),
i.e., explorer ants that construct the initial feed forward structure and
social ants which select nodes from the feed forward connections to
subsequently craft recurrent memory structures. We also incorporate a
Lamarckian strategy for weight initialization which reduces the number of
backpropagation epochs required to locally train candidate RNNs, speeding up
the neuro-evolution process. Our results demonstrate that the sparser RNNs
evolved by ASNE significantly outperform traditional one and two layer

from two different enterprises from 2017 to early 2018. Particularly, we
perform threat vector, social-engineering, vulnerability and time-series
analysis on our dataset. Unlike existing malware studies, our analysis is
specifically focused on the recent enterprise malware samples. First of all,
based on our analysis on the combined datasets of two enterprises, our results
confirm the general consensus that AV-only solutions are not enough for
real-time defenses in enterprise settings because on average 40% of the malware
samples, when first appeared, are not detected by most AVs on VirusTotal or not
uploaded to VT at all (i.e., never seen in the wild yet). Moreover, our
analysis also shows that enterprise users transfer documents more than
executables and other types of files. Therefore, attackers embed malicious
codes into documents to download and install the actual malicious payload
instead of sending malicious payload directly or using vulnerability exploits.
Moreover, we also found that financial matters (e.g., purchase orders and
invoices) are still the most common subject seen in Business Email Compromise
(BEC) scams that aim to trick employees. Finally, based on our analysis on the
timestamps of captured malware samples, we found that 93% of the malware
samples were delivered on weekdays. Our further analysis also showed that while
the malware samples that require user interaction such as macro-based malware
samples have been captured during the working hours of the employees, the
massive malware attacks are triggered during the off-times of the employees to
be able to silently spread over the networks.","{'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=%22time+series%22&start=8000&max_results=1000&sortBy=submittedDate&sortOrder=ascending', 'value': 'We present an empirical and large-scale analysis of malware samples captured\nfrom two different enterprises from 2017 to early 2018.

We show that ordinal networks can be used for estimating\nthe Hurst exponent of time series with accuracy comparable with\nstate-of-the-art methods. Finally, we argue that ordinal networks can detect\nsudden changes in Earth seismic activity caused by large earthquakes.'}","[{'name': 'Arthur A. B. Pessa'}, {'name': 'Haroldo V.

role. Nowadays, sophisticated models often rely on hundreds or even thousands

changes in economy or government policies. As a part of data monitoring, it is
important to identify these changepoints, in terms of which variables exhibit
such changes, and what time locations do the changepoints occur. Being alerted
about the changepoints can help modelers decide if models need modification or
rebuilds, while ignoring them may increase risks of model degrading. Simple
process control rules often flag too many false alarms because regular seasonal
fluctuations or steady upward or downward trends usually trigger alerts. To
reduce potential false alarms, we create a novel statistical method based on
the Bayesian Minimum Description Length (BMDL) framework to perform multiple

breaks occurred in the past, and automatically handling data with or without
seasonality and/or autocorrelation. It is implemented with computation
algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and can be applied to all

changepoint detection method not only triggers alerts, but provides useful

estimation of mean levels and linear slopes before and after the changepoints.

models for large panels of time series. Specifically, we consider the case in
which the autocorrelation of the factors is explicitly accounted for and
therefore the model has a state-space form. Estimation of the factors and of
their loadings is implemented by means of the Expectation Maximization (EM)
algorithm, jointly with the Kalman smoother.~We prove that, as both the
dimension of the panel $n$ and the sample size $T$ diverge to infinity: (i) the
estimated loadings are $\sqrt T$-consistent and asymptotically normal if $\sqrt
T/n\to 0$; (ii) the estimated factors are $\sqrt n$-consistent and
asymptotically normal if $\sqrt n/T\to 0$; (iii) the estimated common component
is $\min(\sqrt T,\sqrt n)$-consistent and asymptotically normal regardless of
the relative rate of divergence of $n$ and $T$. Although the model is estimated
as if the idiosyncratic terms were cross-sectionally and serially uncorrelated,
we show that these mis-specifications do not affect consistency. Moreover, the
estimated loadings are asymptotically as efficient as those obtained with the
Principal Components estimator, whereas numerical results show that the loss in
efficiency of the estimated factors becomes negligible as $n$ and $T$
increase.~We then propose robust estimators of the asymptotic covariances,
which can be used to conduct inference on the loadings and to compute
confidence intervals for the factors and common components. In a MonteCarlo

Through considering individual cases we find that the separation\ninto eruptive and non-eruptive active regions is more robust the longer the\ntime series of observed magnetograms used to simulate the build up of magnetic\nstress and free magnetic energy within the active region. Finally, we conclude\nthat this proof of concept study delivers promising results where the ability\nto categorise the risk of an eruption is a major achievement.'}","[{'name': 'P.

2.5D simulations by solving the magnetohydrodynamic equations on a radially
stretched grid, employing a block-based adaptive mesh refinement scheme based
on a density threshold to achieve high resolution following the evolution of
the magnetic clouds and the leading bow shocks. All the simulations discussed
in the present paper were performed using the same initial grid and numerical

substantial effect on its propagation velocity and on its deformation and

polarity of the internal magnetic field of the CMEs and of the density of the
background solar wind on the arrival times of the shock front and the magnetic

the thickness of the magnetic sheath region) and the deformation and erosion of
the magnetic clouds during their evolution from the Sun to the Earth. Inverse
CMEs were found to be faster than normal CMEs ejected in the same initial

showed that the shock magnitude is not affected by the polarity of the CME.

essential for effective disease management and delivery of medication and

application of evolutionary algorithms. A fundamental novel element of this
work is the use of evolutionary algorithms to both map and predict the
functional connectivity in patients using resting state functional MRI data
taken from the PPMI to identify PD progression biomarkers. Specifically,
Cartesian Genetic Programming was used to classify DCM data as well as
time-series data. The findings were validated using two other commonly used
classification methods (Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines)

findings revealed maximum accuracies of 75.21% for early stage (prodromal) PD
patients versus healthy controls, 85.87% for PD patients versus prodromal PD
patients, and 92.09% for PD patients versus healthy controls. Prodromal PD
patients were classified from healthy controls with high accuracy - this is
notable and represents the key finding of this research since current methods
of diagnosing prodromal PD have both low reliability and low accuracy.
Furthermore, Cartesian Genetic Programming provided comparable performance
accuracy relative to ANN and SVM. Evolutionary algorithms enable us to decode
the classifier in terms of understanding the data inputs that are used, more
easily than in ANN and SVM. Hence, these findings underscore the relevance of

priori unknown functional and structural information from global signals of
living brains activity. To this end we consider a Leaky-Integrate and Fire
(LIF) model with short term plasticity neurons, coupled via a directed network.
Neurons are assigned a specific current value, which is heterogenous across the
sample, and sets the firing regime in which the neuron is operating in. The aim
of the method is to recover the distribution of incoming network degrees, as
well as the distribution of the assigned currents, from global field
measurements. The proposed approach to the inverse problem implements the
reductionist Heterogenous Mean-Field approximation. This amounts in turn to
organizing the neurons in different classes, depending on their associated
degree and current. When tested again synthetic data, the method returns
accurate estimates of the sought distributions, while managing to reproduce and
interpolate almost exactly the time series of the supplied global field.
Finally, we also applied the proposed technique to longitudinal wide-field
fluorescence microscopy data of cortical functionality in groups of awake
Thy1-GCaMP6f mice. Mice are induced a photothrombotic stroke in the primary
motor cortex and their recovery monitored in time. An all-to-all LIF model
which accommodates for currents heterogeneity allows to adequately explain the

method using the convolutional neural net (CNN) model. CNN models were trained
by assembling 25,027 scans (N=12,984 patients) from three hospitals, seven
scanners. A test set of 5,721 scans (N=2,805 patients) evaluated model
performance. The 2D+T AIF time series was inputted into CNN. Two variations
were investigated: a) Two Classes (2CS) for background and foreground (LV
mask); b) Three Classes (3CS) for background, foreground LV and RV. Final model
was deployed on MR scanners via the Gadgetron InlineAI. Model loading time on
MR scanner was ~340ms and applying it took ~180ms. The 3CS model successfully
detect LV for 99.98% of all test cases (1 failed out of 5,721 cases). The mean
Dice ratio for 3CS was 0.87+/-0.08 with 92.0% of all test cases having Dice
ratio >0.75, while the 2CS model gave lower Dice of 0.82+/-0.22 (P<1e-5).
Extracted AIF signals using CNN were further compared to manual ground-truth
for foot-time, peak-time, first-pass duration, peak value and area-under-curve.
No significant differences were found for all features (P>0.2). This study

periodograms which are constructed by trigonometric quantile regression at
different quantile levels, to represent the serial dependence of time series at
various quantiles. At each quantile level, we approximate the quantile spectrum
by a function in the form of an ordinary AR spectrum. In this model, we first
compute what we call the quantile autocovariance function (QACF) by the inverse
Fourier transformation of the quantile periodogram at each quantile level.
Then, we solve the Yule-Walker equations formed by the QACF to obtain the
quantile partial autocorrelation function (QPACF) and the scale parameter.
Finally, we smooth QPACF and the scale parameter across the quantile levels
using a nonparametric smoother, convert the smoothed QPACF to AR coefficients,
and obtain the AR spectral density function. Numerical results show that the
proposed method outperforms other conventional smoothing techniques. We take

Particularly, we explore whether the proposed similarity measure can be
employed to understand the structural evolution of the financial networks with
time. For a set of time-varying financial networks with each vertex
representing the individual time series of a different stock and each edge
between a pair of time series representing the absolute value of their Pearson
correlation, our start point is to compute the commute time matrix associated
with the weighted adjacency matrix of the network structures, where each
element of the matrix can be seen as the enhanced correlation value between
pairwise stocks. For each network, we show how the commute time matrix allows
us to identify a reliable set of dominant correlated time series as well as an
associated dominant probability distribution of the stock belonging to this
set. Furthermore, we represent each original network as a discrete dominant
Shannon entropy time series computed from the dominant probability
distribution. With the dominant entropy time series for each pair of financial
networks to hand, we develop a similarity measure based on the classical
dynamic time warping framework, for analyzing the financial time-varying
networks. We show that the proposed similarity measure is positive definite and
thus corresponds to a kernel measure on graphs. The proposed kernel bridges the

cross-validation (CV) is used as a standard approach in quantifying the

in time-series leads to the loss of serial correlations, a requirement of

happened without the intervention). As a specific use case, we analyze

saliency to characterize the importance of input features to predictions made
by models. Work on interpretability using saliency-based methods on Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs) has mostly targeted language tasks, and their
applicability to time series data is less understood. In this work we analyze
saliency-based methods for RNNs, both classical and gated cell architectures.
We show that RNN saliency vanishes over time, biasing detection of salient
features only to later time steps and are, therefore, incapable of reliably
detecting important features at arbitrary time intervals. To address this
vanishing saliency problem, we propose a novel RNN cell structure (input-cell
attention), which can extend any RNN cell architecture. At each time step,
instead of only looking at the current input vector, input-cell attention uses
a fixed-size matrix embedding, each row of the matrix attending to different
inputs from current or previous time steps. Using synthetic data, we show that
the saliency map produced by the input-cell attention RNN is able to faithfully
detect important features regardless of their occurrence in time. We also apply
the input-cell attention RNN on a neuroscience task analyzing functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data for human subjects performing a variety
of tasks. In this case, we use saliency to characterize brain regions (input
features) for which activity is important to distinguish between tasks. We show
that standard RNN architectures are only capable of detecting important brain

Convolutional long short-term (CNNLSTM) has been successfully applied in time
series data with spatial structure through end-to-end learning. Here, we
proposed a CNNLSTM based neural network architecture termed EEG_CNNLSTMNet for
the classification of EEG signals in response to grating stimuli with different
spatial frequencies. EEG_CNNLSTMNet comprises two convolutional layers and one
bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) layer. The convolutional layers
capture local temporal characteristics of the EEG signal at each channel as
well as global spatial characteristics across channels, while the LSTM layer
extracts long-term temporal dependency of EEG signals. Our experiment showed
that EEG_CNNLSTMNet performed much better at EEG classification than a
traditional machine learning approach, i.e. a support vector machine (SVM) with
features. Additionally, EEG_CNNLSTMNet outperformed EEGNet, a state-of-art
neural network architecture for the intra-subject case. We infer that the
underperformance when using an LSTM layer in the inter-subject case is due to
long-term dependency characteristics in the EEG signal that vary greatly across
subjects. Moreover, the inter-subject fine-tuned classification model using
very little data of the new subject achieved much higher accuracy than that
trained only on the data from the other subjects. Our study suggests that the
fine-tuned inter-subject model can be a potential end-to-end EEG analysis
method considering both the accuracy and the required training data of the new

EEG_CNNLSTMNet comprises two convolutional layers and one\nbidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) layer. The convolutional layers\ncapture local temporal characteristics of the EEG signal at each channel as\nwell as global spatial characteristics across channels, while the LSTM layer\nextracts long-term temporal dependency of EEG signals. Our experiment showed\nthat EEG_CNNLSTMNet performed much better at EEG classification than a\ntraditional machine learning approach, i.e. a support vector machine (SVM) with\nfeatures. Additionally, EEG_CNNLSTMNet outperformed EEGNet, a state-of-art\nneural network architecture for the intra-subject case. We infer that the\nunderperformance when using an LSTM layer in the inter-subject case is due to\nlong-term dependency characteristics in the EEG signal that vary greatly across\nsubjects. Moreover, the inter-subject fine-tuned classification model using\nvery little data of the new subject achieved much higher accuracy than that\ntrained only on the data from the other subjects.

measures, which we term \emph{MJ distances}. These semi-metrics provide an
advantage over existing options such as the Hausdorff and Wasserstein metrics.

outliers, while experiments on simulated data demonstrate that they uncover
similarity within collections of time series more effectively. Semi-metrics
carry a potential disadvantage: without the triangle inequality, they may not
satisfy a ""transitivity property of closeness."" We analyse this failure with
proof and introduce an computational method to investigate, in which we
demonstrate that our semi-metrics violate transitivity infrequently and mildly.
